Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagnosed with certain genetic diseases , are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing frightening effects in our families ' later lives .
When people around us know that we have a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us too much or keeping away from us .
And both are not what we want , since most of us just want to live as normally as possible .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted from worrying about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us throughout our whole life , because we will never know when the `` potential bomb '' will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us to control or cure the disease , we can go through these processes from the scope of the whole family .
For an example , if exercising is helpful for preventing family genetic diseases , we can always look for more opportunities for the family to engage in physical activity .
And we keep track of all family members ' health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members who have this disease .
Here I want to share Forrest 's view on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
The benefits of disclosing genetic risk information outweighs the costs .
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If certain genetic disease tests are very accurate , and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and be known by others , then it is okay to disclose the results .
Above all , life is more important than secrecy .
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
Afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another , although the families have a common genetic makeup , shared by either of the parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the individual 's moral system .
The issue of whether one has the right to know or not to know is highly debatable , although it is a genetic risk ; one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could potentially come from the families of either parent - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts , or cousins .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurrently has a knowledge about others .
This knowledge may be relevant to them , and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Do those who suffer from this disease keep it a secret from their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is also one 's duty to ensure that one undergoes periodic health checks regularly .
Sometimes some family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from - the son or daughter , for example - the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being `` allowed '' to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adults at risk .
In addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than doing so herself ; although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information , as they may not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know , such as nieces and nephews , nor persuade those with authority , namely the parents , to do so .
The notion of authority also extended vertically .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself , whereas the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct , they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to those who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk to make informed decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at-risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how `` directive '' the risk is to them .
People with a close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his or her close relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk so that his or her family members are able to perform some daily precautions to prevent the potential disease or they may go to the hospital and check for the corresponding symptoms .
In my opinion , although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self-privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Focus on the negative side of the announcement of genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it a secret , as the genetic risk may indicate their high chance of carrying certain diseases .
Especially for young people without marriage , if he or she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have a certain chance that his or her child would carry the same disease , but not necessarily so .
Therefore , to keep the information as a secret from one 's future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future , thus going to the hospital and doing additional checks or taking more medication to prevent the disease , which creates unnecessary costs for the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives , as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier , so that they have less chance of getting the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help to keep the privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts on the family members and relatives .
First , for the case of marriage , people should be honest and tell their spouse that they may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offspring .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and a certain type of genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the inherited gene along with their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that he or she has the risk of having diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candy and chocolate to prevent consuming too much sugar , and at the same time , if the carrier tells this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future because of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to consume less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up having diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carrier 's relatives outweigh the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to inform the relatives of the information , so that they can take necessary precautions and prevent the potential disease through early detection and treatment .
Among all kinds of diseases , a large amount of disorders are caused by genetic reasons .
Genetic disorders may or may not be heritable hereditary diseases , and it is sometimes hard to find out if one has these kinds of diseases .
It is a longstanding debate as to whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives that their disease is caused by a gene .
From the legal aspect , the answer is no ; however , from an ethical perspective , the answer should be yes .
We can not make a law to require a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform their relatives about their genetic condition .
It is immoral and impractical .
What kinds of disease someone has is a matter of their own privacy .
Privacy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to reveal another person 's private information , especially when the individual is not willing to do so .
It is against his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
The law 's spirit also includes the fairness .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders ?
It is unfair to release a law that only points to the genetic disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to enforce .
However , there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives the cause of his or her disease .
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters , or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law .
Other relatives may have the same possibility of having such a kind of disease .
How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?
However , from the ethical point of view , this is a significant concern .
To the carrier themselves , they should have a feeling of responsibility to tell their relatives their genetic disorder .
By doing this , they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with a bad gene may not necessarily have those genetic diseases , if they can have corresponding healthy lifestyles before the age at which the gene 's function becomes stronger .
A typical example is genetic caused hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems , which make the carrier 's body harder to process fat and salt in the blood , which can lead to hypertension .
People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become adults .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertension .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat , and thus avoid hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society can not force genetic problem carriers to tell their disease to their relatives , but they should be willing to inform their relatives about their genetic problems .
By doing so , fewer of his or her loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancements , many medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk were to be shared within the family or relatives , there might be chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may take necessary precautions to prevent .
But , if it is a terminal disease , as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon learning about it .
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not .
Some said that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered a personal information that should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after realizing their condition .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives , as he or she might end up disappointing his or her extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope that they will not bring any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some people may wish not to become a burden on anyone , as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some see it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or take measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on the type of genetic disease , given in the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is detected in the early stages .
Hence , with the knowledge of having a genetic risk , the relatives of individuals with this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them from realizing it at an earlier stage .
In conclusion , it is considerate to inform the relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Although there may be many challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some people think that it might be better for those who are unaware of it and will continue living a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having a genetic risk of the disease , it will just add to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it .
All-in-all , it depends on the individual and also the nature of the disease , but the person should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Genetic testing is a personal decision , with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk at all .
Early examination is healthy because it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given regarding informing his or her relatives .
There should not be forced or obligated to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relatives should be made with the consideration of the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile , or they may be unaware of the consequences of such a genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent of the parents or the patient itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be put on the immediate family , as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves .
Some families may feel hurt , with regard to their family pride or reputation , on learning that a genetic disorder runs in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic diseases is vital as it may help to raise awareness and preventions towards the genetic disorders .
Also , this known information will help their relatives make informed decisions and similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that such a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it were made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital because they ensure that the genetic risk carrier knows they are not alone in facing this illness , and it will certainly provide a moral boost as the whole family shares a common sentiment regarding the future prospects of the genetic disorder , which could be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such a genetic disorder will be dependent on the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision to inform others .
A person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easily aware by his or her families .
When things come to genetic issues , it 's not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance is passed down from generation to generation , but not all offspring show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with a potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms .
As a result , in the case that when one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should be aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder 's symptoms manifest in a child , the parents will be informed by the medical professionals for certain , and the entire family will remain vigilant about their physical condition .
On the contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his or her own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue .
That is true ; of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilemma .
And of course , he or she will think of not having any children after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well .
As a result , the family generation stops when the adult carrier announces his issue .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural background will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren to make the family lively and stronger .
The reason behind this is that after World War II , the population of China decreased dramatically , and so the government encouraged the people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fall into an ethical dilemma for sure .
Medical technology during that time was not advanced enough to cure him .
He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous with a potential genetic risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo genetic disorder testing and let the truth remain hidden forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about what are the consequences of telling their relatives about their genetic disorder issues .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to support the family .
Regrettably , if the disorder is rare and unlikely to be fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
One of the reasons why is because as a carrier , they need a mental support to go through with this situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own .
By telling their family , besides providing emotional support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier .
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family , as other family members might experience the same thing .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up for themselves , and it would be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves .
I find that it is important to inform others , especially if it is contagious , as the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading to society .
For every action , there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden on her family .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will occur when the carrier decides to tell his or her family about their condition .
In conclusion , I personally feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with his or her feelings and I find that it is the right of the family members to know what is going on in their lives .
If anything were to happen to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members , it could make a huge regret in their lives if she were to leave without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even financial from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease .
True enough , there are many cancer patients who are given a second chance to live a normal life as they have strong mental support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong , we can fight any disease that comes to us when we are fragile and weak .
As the technology has been advancing , it has reached a stage where its advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of the technology .
Genetic testing has been made possible ; it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness ; however , it could also make the situation worse by revealing who the carrier is within the family .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives , and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that he or she has a right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
Of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier ; however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and is willing to accept it , he could do so , and it has been something that is normal for everyone in the past , as genetic testing was not possible .
It would be better for him or her this way .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real life .
I personally think that this is the right purpose of going through genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled child does not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has a right not to oblige to tell anyone , but has a responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemmas .
If the result turns out to be something that the carrier can not accept , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true facts .
After realizing that he or she is the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact and create more unhappiness within the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives , but he has no obligation to tell still .
In fact , I strongly believe that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and take an appropriate action based on the results .
The emotional depression that the carrier may experience and the sense of guilt can be more than expected and could be a burden on one 's mind for the rest of their lives .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome the disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without having emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years as to whether a carrier for a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be shared with others , especially close family or relatives , is the topic worth discussing .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemmas are involved .
In this essay , few arguments will be presented in support of the view that any carrier of a known genetic risk should inform their relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world .
We were crying hard , but we 're not alone ; it 's our family and relatives who brought us up .
Hence , they should be the ones who are grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together .
However , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of a serious disorder , it may seem that there is no point in sharing , but this involves more than just sharing bad news .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
As the case of a health issue is related to genetic risk , with a focus on `` genetic '' which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree that it is obligatory for a carrier of known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives to avoid any potential family-related ethical dilemmas that could arise in the future .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issues or to bear it within himself/herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed in facing such a risk of disorder .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk .
On top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , it will likely involve more than just one family .
It is therefore I would agree that it is the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and having a plan for giving birth .
This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemmas .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stance of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test is conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
The benefits of doing so outweigh its disadvantages .
More support must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing at such a junction as to whether they should inform their relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is the common law in the society .
However , it leads to a new problem that a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still a diversity of points of view among the people .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue whether or not a carrier should tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : `` I will be anxious about my family when he or she tells me that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk '' .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families so as to continue their own life without the anxiety of families .
It is obvious that it is better for one person to be worried than many .
Many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges on their own .
With the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against the disease .
Demon is not easily defeated and it requires a lot of energy and psychological support .
Families give you the courage and support that you can not retrieve by yourself .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic condition is very serious and can not be adequately described .
The seriousness can be greater than our imagination .
Lying on the bed for the remainder of one 's life , and even dying immediately , are the consequences that we can not imagine .
Families are our dearest in our lives .
Without their concern and support , we would be hard-pressed to get through this time .
They play the important role in our lives that can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to inform the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesirable consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's family without the agreement of the carrier .
It is the ethics of the staff in a hospital to keep the secrets of any patients .
We can not blame them because they are liable to the undesired consequences .
However , hospitals can provide a counselor to advise the carrier about the actions that can be taken .
Therefore , such circumstances will not happen again .
It is a method that benefits two parties , which is a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special cases that are hard to define .
Thus , advice from hospitals plays an important role in this .
Carrier is responsible for balancing his or her own interests and the benefits of family and society .
It is a hard decision to make , but with the most appropriate approach , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and their families in the future .
With the risk of being genetically disordered , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing .
With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical problem : they should warn their relatives about the risk of being the same genetic risk carrier .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
In the view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
First of all , from the angle of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of private matter to carriers .
They may not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do n't want others to know about it .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympathized by others , which is not a positive factor brought into their life .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers .
This obeys their own willingness as in they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable .
Many people may argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of the carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of the early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors , including psychological influences and social influences , are taken into consideration .
If one such relative is told that he or she may have a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may be scared about the unknown future , partners , spouse , and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may arise , which means the relative 's life may be severely impacted .
On the other hand , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing independently .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted from the point of human rights , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
For a carrier of a genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemmas rather than getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
There are four reasons why people do not have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions , both physically through actions to reduce the chance of its being inherited to offspring and mentally if the action fails to prevent its being inherited .
Many syndromes , such as Down syndrome and Turner syndrome , can be prevented from happening if the mother undergoes proper medication and does not consume harmful substances during the pregnancy period .
This information may not be known by the mother if she does not tell her relatives about her condition .
More people knowing her problem , more information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , then the family must accept this fact and do whatever they can to create a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parents ' fault because there are still chances of the gene being inherited .
So , they have to also prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases cost highly for treatment and medication .
Albinism is one of the examples .
The people with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their bodies well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you have suffered from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive .
To prevent the bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does not tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sickle cell anemia .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene , which may lead to circulatory problems such as blood blockages .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives , then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do not need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Fourthly , it is important for parents to give mental support to their children with a genetic disorder .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
People and friends often mock at your condition .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from the closest ones .
If not theirs , then who else is willing to do that ?
It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepared their minds first by disclosing the information on the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder .
In this modern world , the technologies have been improved a lot compared with the last century .
Particularly , in the medical field , there has been a great improvement in many treatments for many formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods that are used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
The medical authorities claim that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma arises .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives about this .
This is because their relatives have the right to know about this .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives ; that is , one of the family members being at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost an equal risk of having it , so this problem should be taken very seriously by the family .
Every family member has the right to know what is going on with them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their rights ?
For instance , John was informed by his doctor that he was at risk for a genetic disorder , but he did not tell his sibling , James , about this .
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what will be likely to happen to him .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder , which prevents certain genetic disorders from affecting themselves .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , `` Prevention is better than cure '' ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are aware of having such a disorder can prevent the disorder from happening by adopting a healthy lifestyle , which includes having a balanced diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives .
This is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from happening .
Together with the advancement of technology over the past decades , medical advancements have increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly being upgraded. Empowering doctors with advanced medical knowledge , doctors are able to diagnose and conduct genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their lives. However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a question arises as to whether to disclose the results to his or her relatives , which becomes a challenging issue for both the patient and the doctor. In my opinion , I strongly believe that it is essential to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .
As it is a genetic risk , the patient 's next of kin might have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur. For example , if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately , you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child ; hence , by letting your family members know about the situation , it would lessen family stress and suffering , and force you to settle down and have children. However , social ethics issues like discrimination and privacy are the biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforcing patients or doctors to disclose information to patients ' relatives. It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles. Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives ; it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members. Early disclosure to family members brings in positive reactions and prevention , as in the case of Angelina Jolie , who chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent. I still recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However , there are still people against the decision of revealing private information. As in the case of Alzheimer 's patients , it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information. However , research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who , how , and to whom Alzheimer 's disease will be disclosed to minimize potential negative impacts on family members ( Dementia Today , 2012 ) . There are associations that provide help to Alzheimer 's patients , such as the Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association , 1980 ) . Although there are still thousands of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all the help and support from everyone , the need to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult times .
In conclusion , the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors as to how far a doctor should opt to reveal to relatives about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to the patient 's decision. In addition , the state could also encourage the creation of assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients , thus encouraging them to open up for the benefit of themselves and their family members. Although it may face challenges from social ethics issues , in the long term , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would likely have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measures to protect their own health and that of their loved ones .
Nowadays , the study in the field of genetics has progressed significantly due to the rapid advancements in technology .
Not long ago , the Human Genome Project , sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) , had been started .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technology has been very mature already , another even more popular topic arises .
While most people agree that each individual has his or her own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands on whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the results with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the patients who are carriers of some known genetic risks are supposed to share the truth with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of other people .
To the whole society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore , including students at school , travellers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office , as well as passengers on the street , are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other without doubt .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a group of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell one 's family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family tree .
Moreover , telling one 's family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' lives are no better than death .
Family members , as one of the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , are a crucial factor for them to successfully overcome any possible troubles as a result of a genetic disorder .
A study of New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members present generally recover 2-4 days faster than those cared for by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal illnesses , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panic , which will endanger family harmony .
While every family needs to go through this or that kind of troublesome situation , the more troubles a family has gone through together , the greater the bond will be established between family members , as well as the greater the amount of trust , love , and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other , all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson say , `` What does n't kill you makes you stronger . ''
Being in an Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the patient 's choice whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his or her disease .
The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental , whereas it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest that the person at least shares the information with his or her potential partner ( husband or wife ) , as the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well-informed about many genetic diseases , and many of them will most likely judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or `` weird '' .
This is because many people relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble Boy disease , autism , or Down syndrome .
In those diseases , many who are affected often have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases .
While we do know that we should not discriminate against people based on their limitations , many people still do so , often without even realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about his having a risk of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand fair and similar treatment to others , and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently. Many people really love to hear what they want to hear , and therefore they may just ignore the word `` risk '' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I believe that it is up to the individual whether he or she wants to share the information with his or her family , as his or her family may either be paranoid or judgmental and react differently .
Especially when it 's just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point ; however , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case .
May be we can trust our immediate family members , but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the individual 's decision to inform their relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his or her children later .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers , and therefore they should not have any children since their child may not be able to survive even after being born .
Or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore , although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it is recommended that individuals inform their future partners .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wishes to tell his relatives about his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right to it .
He may have different considerations other than those due to the fear of being judged by others or the possibility of causing unnecessary worry among his family members when deciding whether to reveal the information to his relatives. Regardless of the choice he makes , we need to respect his decision and refrain from imposing our opinions on him , as we have no right to dictate what he should do .
We all know that life is priceless , and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the improvements of technology , a new life with a genetic risk can be detected .
Genetic refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore , an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have a genetic risk .
One of the reasons why the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
The child with a genetic risk may not have the ability to work , build up the family with others , and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy things that a normal person can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he or she is not able to care for himself or herself .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy burden named medication fees .
Not only the child but also the entire family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain throughout their entire lives .
The other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation 's good .
There are always newspaper reports that a newborn baby has been abandoned at a hospital after they realize the baby has diseases that require a huge amount of money to cure .
For the countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled , such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them .
Without increasing the number of disabilities in a nation , the government is able to focus on developing in other areas such as military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we live today , many miscarriages are conducted in hospitals every day .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore , I believe that the parents have the right to know the health status of their child .
Many people may support the theory that every person has their right to enjoy the world , especially those with religious beliefs .
However , the problem is that will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at the hospital every day and with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what is best for their children , so they will make a right decision after being informed .
Also , humans should improve the medical field in order to prevent tragedies from happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
One should have full control over one 's information , and it is one 's right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple is going to have a baby , they are going to run a few tests and see whether they could have some genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wives .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason for those who argue in favor of this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
If someone has a disease caused by gene A , then it might be a result of gene B as well .
He runs a test and knows that he has the gene AA .
This means both of his parents have gene A , and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and knows that he has the gene Aa .
This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can then take measures , if this disease can somehow be prevented , to prevent it from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved from personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives ; however , if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume that most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint or encourage certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about the negative consequences that come with disclosing their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that those who might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obliged to tell his or her relatives , they might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very serious disease .
After he takes the test and being obliged to tell his relatives , everyone knows that he is a carrier .
So all the married couples go running a test and know they are not carriers. They might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family members may test positive , and he may need to inform whom .
If that is a big family , he is obliged to tell everyone .
Spouses usually have very close relationships ; if Person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needs to run a test because his cousin has this disease .
However , wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease .
Then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a week , half of the town knew that person A had a risk gene , and his family might be a genetically at-risk family .
Then nobody wants to marry him , or his relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his or her information , especially when the party that he or she is obligated to disclose his or her information to is a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Nowadays , people do not only pursue the comfort of their own lives but also strive for a better development of their future generations .
Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it has become possible for people to make decisions to take genetic tests so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risks that can affect their next generations .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is whether people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
And there are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations .
The awareness of your relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellbeing and health of your relatives .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is a great possibility that your relatives , such as parents or siblings , are also carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone testing and know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to get the checks done regularly .
Therefore , telling the families and relatives to prepare themselves for fighting the disease and preventing its occurrence is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
Being the parent , you are not responsible to your next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer them a chance to decide whether to have a child or not .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has become so advanced , it may be possible in the future that the application of gene alteration is perfected and widely used ; you can then choose to give birth to babies with a brighter future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing genetic testing in the first place .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone the genetic testing and are aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your future generations by telling your relatives and families the truth .
To tell or not to tell
Consider a case where we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the results of it .
We found that we actually are the genetic risk carriers .
Then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well .
There are many things we need to consider .
Every choice we make may have a huge impact on their whole life .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives because we really care about their health status .
For example , diabetes is a type of genetic disease .
Once we found that we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits , such as eating less sugary foods and maintaining a good mood .
And it is important for those young people .
The earlier we tell them , the better habits they will develop and better for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic testing as well to see whether they are carrying it or not , which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue that why we want to interfere with their lives ?
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to learn that they or their descendants may have a severe disease , such as blood disease , which is untreatable .
Imagine you are living like a normal person , but suddenly one day your relative comes and tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future - what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
It may affect our daily lives , and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on anything .
At the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct , which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing ; therefore , we are inadvertently causing them trouble .
Personally , I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it a positive way .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still allow them to make their own choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them that they will start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem , and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby carrying this genetic risk as well .
They always have a choice as to whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones ; we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk .
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused socially extensive controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation .
This essay will illustrate in two aspects .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass on their genes to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying a risky genetic mutation , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment .
So for the consideration of other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can help avoid passing on genetic diseases to the next generation when intending to have children .
They should let their spouse know about their situation before marriage .
They need to ask for a doctor 's advice before planning to have a baby .
Some genetic genes will pass only to boys rather than girls , while others do so conversely .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may be at risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story on a newspaper many years ago .
A couple in China has a five-year-old son .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosed with a kind of genetic disease , which is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenic disorder and that it could pass only to boys rather than girls .
Therefore , his son was inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife had actually known about the polygenic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband .
The son was dead after one year 's treatment , and the couple got divorced later as well .
If the wife had not hidden the truth and sought a doctor 's advice before they had a baby , the tragedy would not have happened .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , it can inform members of the carrier 's family about the possible disease they may have and enable timely treatment if necessary .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic test .
We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face a disorder problem .
However , I thought that genetic information is one person 's personal privacy , which should be protected by the law .
Therefore , I think that a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
There are three reasons as follows .
Firstly , the information concerning the genetic is something personally which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission , even though they are his or her family or relatives .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
Once people 's genetic information is shared with others .
They may know the person 's potential disability or other negative factors naturally .
They may set a bias against this person , even abandoning him or her .
People do not have the ability to choose their genes ; therefore , they should not be judged negatively because of their genetic makeup .
So I think whatever the genetic information is or whether the gene matches with their parents , it should not be told to anyone , even his or her family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family , even breaking the relationship between children and adults .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have a relation with them .
However , happy they were before , there would be some barriers that would appear , which would truly destroy the family gradually .
The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter .
The parents give knowledge and love to the children , and they feel happy with the company of the children .
The children rely on their parents to live .
When they grow up , they take care of their old parents and thank them for their dedication .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of a broken family due to a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Finally , the technology of testing the gene was not very mature then .
There also exists some probability of incorrect testing .
If the wrong test results were not detected by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for the rest of their lives .
Therefore , I think a person knowing genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of incorrect testing , for the sake of family peace , I support the notion that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his or her family or relatives without the individual 's consent .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done a genetic test .
If there 's no problem , that will be wonderful .
However , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
Therefore , once people find that they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible for telling their relatives , at least their family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and share the same ancestor , so of course they share the same genes in some degree .
Therefore , there is nothing to be shy about or afraid of .
If the person tells their relatives that they carry a disease gene , their relatives can go to the hospital to check whether they also carry a disease gene .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring .
Also they can prevent the disease from going to their offspring .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help ; they will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or she does not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he or she carries a disease gene .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of doctors .
Or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby , which could lead to the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
There is a story I saw on TV .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time ; their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to the hospital to check what was the problem .
After coming back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene , which meant they could n't have a baby in their lifetime .
The woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the conversation and decided to divorce her husband .
After got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man .
At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her , but she ruined her happiness .
Tears showed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they were born with .
However , they can avoid passing on the disease genes to their children .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
However , there arises a family-related ethical dilemma as to whether it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that their relatives have the right to know the result .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of these risks still exist , the consequences will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and make emotional preparations .
Taking Angelina Jolie as an example , she is famous , yet she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
Everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
In addition , although it may be possible in some cases that he or she and the family may undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , how people can face more dramatic tragedies such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation .
Life is hard , but people should n't blame it on being unfair .
It is just because you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse ; you should feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever ; but when it is revealed , it will be even more shocking and upsetting .
As the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives that telling the genetic testing results is necessary .
Last but not least , although genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the results to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy among each other , as well as promote awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and anxiety about the risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing results for the sake of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but it is necessary for carriers and their families .
In addition , emotional preparations and the way you explain your genetic condition are also important , so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives , and if necessary , guide them if they wish to conduct a similar genetic test .
The Impact of Social Media
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to stay away from it .
I started involving myself on Facebook one year ago , when I just arrived in Singapore .
And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of seeds every day .
We know each other 's statuses , changes and so on through social media .
For an example , if we change our contact numbers , we will no longer send SMS to each individual separately .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform these kinds of changes .
And if you 're not on it , you will just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free .
We discuss everything we like , and we have more personal space. Our friends also get more access to know what we 're doing and what we like .
And also , we get a chance to talk to public figures like popular stars and learn about their lives better .
In China , many government organizations have opened blogs to communicate with people , such as firefighters , police stations , and others .
Social media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on .
And actually , lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media , such as looking for people who are lost , and so on .
With more convenient and humanitarian communications , the relationship between governments and people gets largely improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social media .
We can learn more about news and cultures through social media .
From this scope , social media has shortened our distance .
However , we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convenient , advanced , and interesting .
And even when we gather together , more people find themselves having fewer topics to talk about than before and choose to dig into their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it seem as though we are in front of each other ; sometimes , when we are by each other 's side , we seem to be farther away .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationships not as stable , secure , and reliable as they were before .
Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or traveling experiences .
To some extent , this makes our life more luxurious and leisurely .
For myself , I am longing to visit some places after I saw those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes I even can not sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our lives pattern so fast and leaves us less time to think about our lives .
Social media is becoming more important , and we need to think more critically to make it serve us better and better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skill , require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
For an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hard copy previously , over the web ; the process takes just seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately , depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived as almost in real-time .
Next , communication is also greatly improved .
In the past , vast communications were done by one of the many methods such as telegrams , snail mail , and poor-quality voice calls .
With the advent of applications such as Skype and FaceTime , anyone can phase out most of the old-fashioned communication methods .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcam could also be affixed to emulate a `` real '' interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media .
However , it is a good practice not to intensely use social media all the time .
Intimate interaction greatly lacks in social media interactions , particularly in touch .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction which utilizes the motor , thinking , and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done with thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for a proper interpersonal relation .
It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Gardner studied the effect of multiple intelligences among people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of intelligence on its own - some have it , some do not .
Howard Gardner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance with utilizing tests , and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who score lower on rankings for interpersonal skills are more likely to struggle when this skill is needed .
Though social media does not need to be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly , for example , for work , family , and friends .
The types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussing and others .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
For people who are living very far from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified .
For those who live within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communication with each other .
And at the same time , it improves the interpersonal skills through dynamic practices between individuals and real-time presence .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring about a better rapport between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media has helped people to have more closer connections with each other ; it is a more convenient and cheaper way to maintain online contact compared to face-to-face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chances for people to have face-to-face contact , and thus , negatively impact interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face-to-face contacts among people .
First , social media networks have a large user base ; it helps to connect people from different parts of the world .
In the days without social networks , people may not have had the chance to know others from different countries or those they had never met before .
Their number of people that they know may only be limited to the people they meet in daily life , such as classmates and working partners .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people , and they may have a chance to chat with people they have never known before ; this helps to develop interpersonal skills as well .
Secondly , although social networks take time for people to chat online rather than face-to-face , they may still decide on a time online to meet others face-to-face in their daily lives .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talking .
For example , if social networks did not exist , businesspeople would need to meet each other face to face , which would be time-consuming , even for businesses that are not particularly important ; it would still take a lot of time traveling , which would be a waste .
However , social networks help people to meet and chat much more easily ; they can even use video chat and create group chats to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants , as it saves time and reduces costs .
The social network may also create some negative impacts on the people .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute .
They take too much time using online social networks and thus do not have time to have their daily meetings with people in their real lives .
It not only affects the interpersonal skills but also is bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe ; people may not protect their privacy online effectively , and sometimes , some people may use others ' personal information to deceive .
In conclusion , although the online environment is often unsafe , spending too much time on the internet may be a potential negative factor of using online social networks .
It provides people with a more convenient communication environment and improves the frequency of meetings with each other .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than the costs .
The world is increasingly becoming flat due to all kinds of social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who leaves thousands of miles away eats for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media really has a lot of advantages because it lets us communicate with friends more cheaply and more conveniently .
However , its disadvantages also can not be ignored when you consider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cybercrime .
Social network sites provide us with many conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his/her latest news by scanning the webpage .
It can help us know more about each other .
It can make people become closer too .
For example , if you find out one of your friends ' favorite singers is Justin Bieber through Facebook , you can give him or her Justin Bieber 's new album or concert tickets as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet , and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social networking sites can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we might lose contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them , and I know what they are doing recently because we live close to each other .
The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable .
A research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thought when he or her say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personalities by reading things that he or she posts on social network media .
It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those `` nice '' guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on Facebook .
It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other , but just look at their cellphones .
This kind of behavior is not good for people 's psychological health according to a research .
The cyber communication is quite different from face-to-face communication , and people who depend too much on cyber communication may not get used to real-life communication .
In addition , cyber relationships can not always work in real life .
With no close relationships in real life , but only close cyber friends , one is more likely to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others through our five senses .
With the willingness of people to become the best among others , social networking sites have now become a place to showcase oneself .
Some people will post their expensive things or the overseas places of interest they have been to on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so .
It is a mental health issue and it may trigger people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is convenient for criminals to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , social networking sites are like a double-edged sword , and people can only take full advantage of them by being aware of the potential drawbacks , such as limiting the amount of personal information shared on their Facebook pages .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within contemporary society ; and people can communicate with each other online or offline on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites , physical human interactions among people have been reduced , as people will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and downsides of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media is able to disseminate information faster than any other medium .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learned about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than they do on reading newspapers .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to gain access to social media sites , which have made it easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted in the temporary closure of schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information at a relatively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cybersecurity policies that roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes from spreading around .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security measures to control almost every social networking movement .
Social media are able to improve relationships and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenagers today claim that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends , and it would take relatively long time to send the letter overseas .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other conveniently .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationships as well as make new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media , as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
In addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
But , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve their relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancements , and there are more to come in the future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly eased long-distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience .
With a globalized and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the main platforms for social interaction .
With just a touch away from any media/electronic device , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle .
Thus , long-distance relationships or friendships can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of statuses about one 's personal feelings or experiences , and being able to reply to these posts allows human interaction to be engaged and expanded with ease .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platforms .
Thus , socialization can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilization of such social media platforms. Meetups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
The society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interactions are being transformed into cyber interactions .
With the frequent use and reliance on social media and the internet , a society that socializes through cyberspace will be more advanced and adaptable to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using a social media platform to communicate is credibility .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain about the reliability or truth of some posts or information we receive through the Internet .
We may actually be communicating with a hoax Facebook account of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real , but in reality , it is a fake account .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agendas .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction , which can be stimulated through other means .
Although emojis can be used to show certain emotions , this differs from the real , authentic emotion of your friends when you observe them through their body language and facial expressions .
The danger of such media socialization is the uncertainty of such communication due to the lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human interpersonal behavior since communication is made through social media instead of meetups .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another , which can adversely affect one 's behavior .
The lack of exposure to real-life interactions with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance between both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction among its people .
Nowadays , people can even use their phones to read news , and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artists or celebrities they love and Facebook to see what their friends ' recent activities are .
Nevertheless , they still can use phones to do normal calls and send messages to contact .
Not only the phone did the job for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many others that are able to connect to the internet .
It is obvious to see that the internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media that actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people .
People can only use electrical devices to access the internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and their fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
As a result , they will lose the ability to maintain eye contact and the use of their hands to express their feelings to people around them , which means they have lost the essential tools they need for face-to-face communication .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any conversation , as they were both holding and gazing at their mobile screens with one hand while using the other hand to hold a fork .
A group of friends having high tea in a café without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screens .
The children nowadays do not know what neighborhood games are and who is staying beside them ; all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
These are some concrete examples of how social media reduces face-to-face human contact .
When people get used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will deteriorate and be lost eventually .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate effectively with people face-to-face and not be trained in their conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them do their jobs , but it indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media does have some other advantages besides their general benefits to humans .
First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and read news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via social media software instead of making an international call , which costs a lot for a normal salary family .
He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using a video call via the internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to update their friends on their recent activities easily .
A person who is going to travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his plans .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save work most of the time .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways , but at the same time , it also harms people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and humans live happily .
All of us are living in a technological society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
It started with the invention of technology , which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we traveled by ship ; now we can use an airplane to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message because we had to post our letters ; now , we can use email , which stands for electronic mail , to send messages to our friends or even use our handheld phone to send our messages .
From the example that I have mentioned earlier , we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is getting further apart .
This is because by the ease of technology such as airplanes , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the mediums that we need .
Nevertheless , everything in life has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will be discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in touch and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
This approaches help the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas .
The social media is beneficial because it connects you and your loved ones , even though you are separated by distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among youngsters .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their Facebook page , as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and studies .
This will then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own life by making the right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites ; however , in this case , striking a balance between social media use and real-life interactions is the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the use of social media platforms is a common place in our lives .
In an increasingly globalized world , such platforms both enhance and complicate the links between individuals worldwide .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts on individuals ' daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in society as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
As people feel more confident online , where they do not have to face criticism in real life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and therefore prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially young students , as they often have the option to turn their backs on real life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realize how to interact with people in real life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into social media , the more they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short-term and quickly gone , thus do not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to a research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook , and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with others ' lives .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make users stay connected with others .
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
However , the friendship on such a virtual world is so superficial , which is not very relevant to real life .
Also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they make it a platform to fish for customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this also possibly triggers privacy issues , as Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information of its users .
As this happens , users are more and more prone to any possible frauds .
Social media sites are at their peak at the moment ; however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real life , they will not be as indulged in them as they are now .
The users soon will realize that they do not need such social media sites to keep in touch with their friends because , if they really need someone , they will reach out to their friends no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or are we falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were born with the intention of connecting people from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays most people , including the older generation , will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The parents are now the `` friends '' of their kids , and they can now `` follow '' their kids more closely and in real-time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so-called friends .
However , as we tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced face-to-face human contact , which eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and at different settings .
We may meet only once , but we exchange our contact numbers as well as Facebook accounts in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like Facebook is a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to be connected .
Within seconds , we could check on the friend 's profile and read through his or her updates .
On the other hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall , and our friends could read up on the news feed .
This allows friends who may not have the time for meeting up to stay connected in a way .
Not only that , new friends can be easily made through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is that the time spent on face-to-face contact is reduced .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to send a birthday wish when Facebook prompts us `` Today is someone 's birthday '' .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send wish cards during festive seasons like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and , of course , to receive one with stamps on it .
Gone are the times when we used to send handwritten letters , and now we do mass sending and the recipient may feel less meaning in such online wishes .
As time passes , we may have more `` friends '' on the list , but the meaning of friendship needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The users of every social media site need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms , but be careful of their impact on the actual lives we have .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings ; however , social media sites are merely tools to enhance it .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe 80 percent of people play social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
It consists of the functions of connecting , sharing , interacting , and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to the social media , which are concerning in society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives .
First , with the function of social media sites that connect people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and family , or even strangers , without any time or place constraints .
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over 1,000 miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without having to travel to other countries .
It saves a lot of money and time , as well as strengthens our relationship , even though we stay at different places around the world .
Besides that , companies can also use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook , Twitter , or Skype , to facilitate meetings with project parties from around the world .
Substantial costs are saved without the tiresome travel from one place to another .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors , which benefit the company more and boost its profits .
However , there are two sides to every story .
Some scholars argue that the use of social media reduces the face-to-face communication between humans .
Since ancient times , humans have interacted with each other face-to-face .
Without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of the speaker .
That is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , `` social media sites will affect writing skills , '' that is the point of view in society .
Based on the statistic report , the more writing skills will be reduced as the more time spent on social media sites .
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
The auto-correction software is so effective when using electronic devices that we did n't realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill of people who express their own feelings and opinions .
'Privacy ' , this is the word that is popular in these few decades .
Human beings have their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news about the social media sites leaking users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Everything we type in the social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Although it looks like there are no laws , it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by government laws but also spied on by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides to every story .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology effectively , we should make an effort to not only balance the pros and cons but also extend the benefits while minimizing the drawbacks .
Thus , the new technology will bring a prosperous future for our and the next generation .
With the widespread spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming increasingly popular .
Getting connected on social media , such as Facebook and Twitter , has become a main trend as well as a part of daily life nowadays .
With this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life .
On one side , it is obviously that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get in touch with each other every time and everywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media makes it possible to have interactions by keeping comments .
When our phones are accidentally dropped , we can also use social media to get in touch with our friends .
Some people who are trying to talk in public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media .
Besides , we can make more friends through such interactions when our friends also bring their friends along .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update their friends ' status and contact with friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to rethink the influences brought by social media .
There are still many disadvantages of using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people 's lives , people are increasingly willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face communication , which has a time and place requirement .
People who are not good at public speaking may be more reluctant to talk to others , and their communication skills can not be improved under these circumstances .
Secondly , people 's over-addition may , to some extent , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation can cause some social media users to suffer from over-dependence on virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real life .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing up with social changes to get hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of updates in luxury living standards as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily lives more and more extravagant , which is not an accurate social growth trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction and their studies and work may be greatly influenced .
Since we can see both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may still be lasting for a long time .
Therefore , every time we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media .
In the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier .
Geographical and transportation barriers are no longer a problem because communication and information technologies have been enhanced continuously .
Telephone may have been perceived as a big innovation when it was first introduced by Graham Bell .
However , since the internet was known , telephones started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to the users .
Let us take an example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and addresses may change from time to time. On Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using names and photos as identifiers .
Facebook is like a combination of messaging and chatting services , personal profiles , media-sharing platforms , and other entertainment features .
social games ) , which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter , which has more simplified functions compared to Facebook , provides more benefits if used as an information-sharing medium .
Twitter only allows users to give updates that are limited to short sentences in order to spread the word quickly , which only highlights messages that are delivered .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered , as multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects that people may not realize until afterwards .
Research shows that face-to-face meeting frequency among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As the consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say ; however , in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth , even if not well arranged , is the picture of your personality .
This skill requires practice and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant , but everybody is busy with their own gadgets , posting pictures on Facebook , updating their statuses on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
These social media serve a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries , but it does not mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that was mentioned before , which can decrease qualitatively if we are used to interacting with gadgets rather than human beings .
Another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected parts of our lives , we build a `` false image '' in the public .
We tend to only share our happy moments on media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problems at all .
Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think of themselves as lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does not always give advantages .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of .
It is up to individuals ' discretion and comprehension to decide which side they wish to take .
So , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefits and losses of every decision that we make .
Nowadays , the advancement of technologies improves the lives of many people significantly .
In most countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people , while some others argue that there are several negative impacts on society .
One of the advantages that are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before .
In the past decades , when social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone or even a letter .
However , calling a person using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who lives far away , especially in villages , takes much time .
The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved .
People connecting through social media sites can spend no money on communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are unable to find them through a phone or a letter .
If phones and letters are the only ways to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to making connections between us and our old friends .
Hence , the social media sites serve as a platform for connection .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts on the people and society .
The advancement of these social media sites makes people so reliant on them that some of them rather prefer using these sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn lead to the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of these sites .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to stay in touch with people and keep up-to-date with the latest news has become a tremendous demand .
Some of the famous examples would be social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook .
With an increasing number of users of more than a billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly their success in playing an important part in our lives .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings about a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users ' needs are an internet connection and an email account , so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Secondly , it helps people to keep in touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easy than asking people around in real life .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up to date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with just a click away on the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups , pages , or sites to share our hobbies , interests , and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our globally interconnected world .
However , social media sites also have another side of negative impact on humans .
Undeniable , it becomes more addictive when we spend more time socializing and interacting virtually .
We spend the majority of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter , and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
Incorporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on their personal leisure activities rather than concentrating on their work .
Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also brings in a bad impact for us in the long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on face-to-face interactions with one another .
Hence it lessens valuable interaction between humans and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites that people use fake IDs to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and create a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to an unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has its two-sided effect and it depends on how we exploit it .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites ; however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction , as it plays an even more important role in our lives .
As more and more social websites , such as Twitter , Facebook , and Weibo , which have become ubiquitous , seamless , and imperative in our lives , people may worry about the younger generation having problems with face-to-face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms greatly outweigh their repercussions .
Social media enables us to explore the world far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a week 's holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smartphone or a computer at school , at work , or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with just a click and get to know about their lives through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos , and statuses .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversations are easier for strangers to open up to each other .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the homepage , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about .
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of the information posted online is true , whereas a person may like only 3 out of 10 times in real life .
This shows that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That is because we act as who we are in reality , whereas we have no reason to do so in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes the genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as the prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize these repercussions through strict regulation of content online .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
People around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots that occurred in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulate the thoughts of the public .
For example , in the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr. Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the time people spend on face-to-face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hand .
They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends being by their side and teaching them to manage their time well .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives .
What we can do is to carefully manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
With the regulation of governments and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better place .
Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thank you to those who use social media , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication , despite the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trade can be done through social media as well .
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear , such as a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , and the potential for fraud that can occur through social media .
Twitter , Facebook , and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites , we are able to communicate with them , learn about their activities and who their friends are , etc. From a surface-level perspective , it is undeniable that these sites facilitate a stronger bond with our relatives despite the physical distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , which is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media accounts ; for example , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and updates its followers with headline news .
That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without them needing to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business through these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online ; we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered an advantage for us , the buyers .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
I do think there is a difference in it , and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our true feelings and may not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the tone of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave in telling others about their opinions online , but in real life , some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to a bad interpersonal skill as well as a problem of trust .
Nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media , since we will never know whether they are even `` real '' .
Some people fake their identities on media sites so that they can meet more people or some may even cheat others .
In addition , privacy issues have become more prevalent nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share initially .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our lives , we should consider their drawbacks and thus use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and minimize its disadvantages as much as possible .
It is a common sight that almost everyone in a public transportation system is watching their phone or wearing earbuds in this modern society today .
Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human evolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people so that they can connect with others even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects , such as the loss of face-to-face communication skills , which is important in their workplace .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach others easily , even without being in contact for a long time .
In this fast-paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries and share funny scenes on them , and they can stay updated on the new information of their friends .
Personally , I am studying overseas , a busy study life keeps me away from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends helps me stay informed about their current statuses .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
Many Malaysians cross the sea to work here in Singapore .
Many of them are busy with work and often separate from their children .
One of the managers in my workplace has the same situation .
After my manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her granddaughter .
Therefore , my manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected or closer with similar preferences .
It is easier for people to approach others after knowing the information .
Students can exchange their experiences in studies even if they are in different countries .
People are able to share their culture or post pretty photos online , so others can share in the joy with them .
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of the most useful tools to help people know each other better .
However , social media sites are a double-edged sword ; they also bring in some negative effects on our daily lives .
One of the disadvantages that many people concern is that people lose the interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend as themselves , and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relations , even without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that it affects some people in their ability to develop interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects .
Social media sites are supposed to be a very useful and convenient tool to use , bringing people closer together in this globalized world .
The use of social media has largely influenced our way of communicating with each other .
Online friends became real-life friends , and real-life friends communicate with each other online .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this change .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
In real life , we communicate with each other as equals .
We share ideas , stories , and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on `` broadcasting '' and `` listening '' .
When we use Facebook and post pictures and status updates .
We are actively presenting faces of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , statuses that are funny .
We broadcast these facades of ourselves to others .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking out attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses , seeing one of them that they might think is funny .
It is not the broadcasters themselves who care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help fostering interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing friendships requires a deep understanding of each other and caring for one another .
The latter requires face-to-face interaction , where we can show our emotions to each other .
One can not truly understand a person by only stalking his or her Facebook page , where he or she carefully chooses what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions by expressing them through texting smiley faces : ) alone .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I rarely read newspapers or visit news websites anymore ; because I can easily access them through the updates of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can just follow some political newspapers or public figures .
I get news about sales , clothes , and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes and he or she posts them often , I can simply block him or her from my feed .
Information was circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most , so I can seldom miss it .
Social networks play a role in providing as well as filtering information .
This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points of view , I think social media could foster more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I became real-life friends with those from online forums who shared the same interests as me .
I also discovered some of my friends ' interests , which I found common with myself , so that talking to each other is much more enjoyable about life , studies , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each other 's , but rather on whatever is interesting or the content .
In this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendship that requires a mutual interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages to itself ; however , whether it is good or bad , we are still not sure .
It is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People who live in the modern world really can not live without the social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media enables people to connect with each other more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some individuals , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on social media sites becomes really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this `` cheerful '' meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with each other .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with those who lived far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages .
Nowadays , what people need to do is simply type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient , especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become increasingly addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , they lose their face-to-face interpersonal skills .
Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting , which can not be considered a true form of communication .
When one chats on those media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotional delivery , and even the expressions are typed in using some combinations of punctuation .
For more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words , such as `` lol '' ( which means `` laugh out loud '' ) and `` asap '' ( which means `` as soon as possible '' ) .
People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as possible .
While , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately becomes really a big problem .
Social media also provides people with huge amounts of information about people and things that interest them .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people whom you adore , such as famous movie and television stars , businesspeople , and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their idols ' lives and work .
Updated news that people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smartphones and laptops almost every time at any time .
However , after one has registered on those social media sites that are not reliable , all the information you have provided will be a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on the social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she simply wants to decorate his or her face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites .
How do social media help change our lives ?
As the development of technology progresses , social media plays an increasingly significant role in the whole world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a lot of other things that help their friends know their lives better .
However , it also raised concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or poses a human disaster .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it also reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face-to-face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Many people say that they will support social media because it really helps them to have a closer view of how their friends are doing in other parts of the world .
This is especially for people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything that has happened in their home country and the way they can use it to show their lives to their loved ones as well .
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information .
Nowadays , people can easily put their rental information on their Facebook account and wait for responses from others around the world , bringing us a huge amount of convenience .
It is quite significant , especially for those young teenagers , as they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great many people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the potential bad effects on teenagers who are still developing themselves .
They pointed out that actually social media reduces the chances of us talking to people around us face to face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Nowadays , it is quite common to see at some parties , people would rather look at their phones and read all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry because if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will lose the ability to talk to people face-to-face .
They will feel that it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with others .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages than advantages it gives us .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes us a lot of time as well .
Think in another way , if we put the time we spend on wandering on those sites , we may already have finished one book or done something more meaningful .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our families or friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely , regardless of whether it 's really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media platforms .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life .
The advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Nowadays , as technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily lives .
You can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smartphones or iPads on buses or on trains .
Some may say that the appearance of these modern media will reduce the chances of people communicating face to face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
Firstly , of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other .
Years ago , when these modern products had not been popular , the ways for people to communicate or contact people far away were still restricted to making phone calls , sending emails , or writing letters .
Some will take a long time , and some are not efficient enough for people to get their responses .
However , social media solves these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the internet and get their replies very quickly .
The communication is also not limited in words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People can also get to know their friends ' states and moods by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in a social situation , see the comments online , and share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may do some harm to people 's lives .
It will make people spend more time chatting on the internet rather than communicating face-to-face , which means that their interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Some people spend a lot of time on it and forget their real lives .
Actually , I have seen some people who are very funny and interesting when I chat with them online .
However , they behave quite boringly when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills as they grow up .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems with their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when communicating with people face-to-face .
Some may share less and less time with their families and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something wrong .
In conclusion , the emergence of social media sites is a double-edged sword .
It can make our lives simpler .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through these social media platforms .
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life and affect their interpersonal skills negatively .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantages .
So we need to make the best use of these social media and make it a fun way to add some excitement when life is boring .
And try to bypass the shortcomings .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family regularly .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can know their friends ' recent looks and interesting things happen on that people just by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that social media sites truly enable old friends to maintain contact and stay updated on each other 's lives , even if they are in different countries .
However , social media sites truly reduce face-to-face communication , which truly affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using social media in people 's daily lives .
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and families closely .
By typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people are shy to say `` I love you '' to their mothers , so they can type it on her Facebook page .
Then her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with his parents and friends .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people .
Secondly , the social media sites can only connect people with their friends closely .
People can also know much information about celebrities in Twitter and Facebook , such as Obama , Bill Gates , and gain access to first-hand study materials on these platforms .
They can learn how these people succeed and also have the chance to talk with them and know their thoughts by using social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or individuals who need the money to cure a disease can get help from the world quickly. Because once one person knows the information , they will share it with their friends , and then many people will learn about it and spread the information to someone who can provide assistance .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of social media .
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and family , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing rather than talking .
People even prefer talking to their friends and meeting their friends online , and gradually reject face-to-face communication .
Therefore , social media truly limits interpersonal skills , making it so that people lose the chance and ability to practice talking and connect with their friends .
Secondly , without truly effective communication in real-life situations , people lose the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood .
There are many people on social media who have beautiful images and good content on their pages ; however , in real life , they may not have jobs or live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated and lose money , even though they are safe .
Therefore , the social media is not safe , which is bad for teenagers ' future development .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas .
However , there are some disadvantages that will affect people to some extent .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily Life and Society .
Nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media has become more popular and even important in our daily lives .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook , and microblog , more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to go out of their homes to interact with others ; they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they 've done or funny stories .
It seems that people build a good relationship with others through social media , but problems often arise .
People do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially with strangers .
Then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : being more convenient to contact others , and being easier to know about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others by social media .
In old days , if one wanted to tell someone important news to another person who lived far away , he needed to write letters , and it wasted time .
The long distance and time-consuming nature make spreading the messages very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people may not contact their faraway friends and relatives unless there is something important .
However , people can now contact anyone all over the world who uses a computer at any time , and there is no time delay in messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to know about others through social media .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues , or family members .
And the information collected may not be intact and true .
Unlike today , with the help of social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching online , and know about what that person does every day at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illnesses related to sitting for long periods in front of the computer , the rapid spread of rumors and fake news , and most importantly , eroding people 's ability to communicate confidently with others face-to-face .
It is strange that people sit around the table , yet all face their phones and do not talk to each other .
If there 's a joke on their Facebook page , they may talk to others in this way : `` Hi , look , how ridiculous this is. '' Then they 'll laugh together .
No matter whether it 's a party , dinner , or just a simple get-together , there are always some people who bow their heads and play with their phones even though their family and friends are right in front of them .
In conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while being aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happening to them and their friends and family .
Today 's world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which are attractively connecting people around the world .
However , some people worry that social networking can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows .
Nobody can deny the advantages of social media , which provide numerous benefits in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures , and languages .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos , and every meaningful experience of your life .
More importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media .
Secondly , social media networks open doors of opportunity for people due to their great benefits in connecting .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In business areas , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
On the other hand , social media also has disadvantages , which have created worries for the society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people tend to live in a social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
First and foremost , we should realize that the social media world is not trustworthy and real .
Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone .
Though social media does create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interactions .
There is a story of a girl who lives in the social media world every night for eight years .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people .
She talked with them every night , trusting them and sharing her life with them .
Then eventually , she discovered that eight people had become one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness .
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
People can use the information to deceive family and friends , as well as banks , to do bad things , such as blackmail , ATM theft , and so on .
Last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time spent on social sites and reject opportunities to engage in social daily life activities as well as interact with others .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
As a result , if the situation continues to go on in this unexpected trend , it will have a bad effect on the young generation .
To put it in a nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
So does social media network .
It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing businesses , but it also can damage people 's relationships and interpersonal skills .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way , combining both social media sites and daily life interactions to develop people 's potential to its fullest .
