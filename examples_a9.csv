Currently, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996(HIPAA) in the United States, there is no legal requirement to disclose information to relatives; it is up to the patient to disclose information to their family members. Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reactions and prevention of disease, as in the case of Angelina Jolie; she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer to under five percent. I can still recall that her reason for disclosing her own story was that she did not want to live under the shadow of cancer.","[{'idx_src': [5], 'idx_tgt': [5, 6, 7], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [9], 'corr_type': 'Npos'}, {'idx_src': [7], 'idx_tgt': [10, 11, 12], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [16], 'idx_tgt': [21, 22, 23], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [28], 'idx_tgt': [35], 'corr_type': 'Wform'}, {'idx_src': [30], 'idx_tgt': [37], 'corr_type': 'Vt'}, {'idx_src': [37], 'idx_tgt': [44, 45, 46], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [38], 'idx_tgt': [47, 48, 49], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [48], 'idx_tgt': [59, 60], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [67], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [55], 'idx_tgt': [], 'corr_type': 'Rloc-'}, {'idx_src': [71], 'idx_tgt': [83, 84, 85], 'corr_type': 'Srun'}, {'idx_src': [71], 'idx_tgt': [85, 86], 'corr_type': 'Rloc-'}, {'idx_src': [72], 'idx_tgt': [87], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [73], 'idx_tgt': [88], 'corr_type': 'Wci'}, {'idx_src': [80], 'idx_tgt': [95, 96, 97], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [87], 'idx_tgt': [104, 105, 106], 'corr_type': 'Prep'}, {'idx_src': [95], 'idx_tgt': [114, 115, 116], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [119], 'corr_type': 'Trans'}, {'idx_src': [98], 'idx_tgt': [120], 'corr_type': 'Wform'}, {'idx_src': [105], 'idx_tgt': [127], 'corr_type': 'Wform'}, {'idx_src': [111], 'idx_tgt': [133], 'corr_type': 'Vform'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [142], 'corr_type': 'Npos'}, {'idx_src': [120], 'idx_tgt': [143, 144, 145], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [122], 'idx_tgt': [], 'corr_type': 'ArtOrDet'}, {'idx_src': [126], 'idx_tgt': [150, 151, 152], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [144], 'idx_tgt': [170, 171, 172], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [148], 'idx_tgt': [], 'corr_type': 'Rloc-'}, {'idx_src': [154], 'idx_tgt': [181, 182, 183], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [160], 'idx_tgt': [], 'corr_type': 'Npos'}, {'idx_src': [161], 'idx_tgt': [], 'corr_type': 'Rloc-'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [191], 'corr_type': 'Others'}, {'idx_src': [167], 'idx_tgt': [195, 196, 197], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [175], 'idx_tgt': [205], 'corr_type': 'Nn'}, {'idx_src': [177], 'idx_tgt': [207, 208, 209, 210, 211], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [183], 'idx_tgt': [217, 218, 219], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [228], 'corr_type': 'WOadv'}, {'idx_src': [198], 'idx_tgt': [], 'corr_type': 'WOadv'}, {'idx_src': [202], 'idx_tgt': [238, 239, 240], 'corr_type': 'Mec'}, {'idx_src': [203], 'idx_tgt': [], 'corr_type': 'WOadv'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [242], 'corr_type': 'WOadv'}, {'idx_src': [], 'idx_tgt': [244], 'corr_type': 'Others'}, {'idx_src': [216], 'idx_tgt': [255], 'corr_type': 'Vt'}]"
