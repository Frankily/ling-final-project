Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get certain diseases because of genetic changes .
How much a genetic change tells us about your chances of developing a disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible for you to develop heart disease .
However , for some rare diseases , people who have certain genetic changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagnosed with a certain genetic disease , are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing frightening effects in our family 's later lives .
When people around us know that we have a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether they care for us too much or keep away from us .
And both are not what we want , since most of us just want to live as normal people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted from worrying about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us throughout our entire lives , because we will never know when the " potential bomb " will explode .
On the other hand , if there are ways that can help us control or cure the disease , we can go through these processes from the scope of the whole family .
For example , if exercising is beneficial for preventing disease , we can always look for more opportunities for the family to engage in exercise .
And we keep track of all family members ' health conditions .
At the same time , we are prepared to know if there are any other members who have this disease .
Here I want to share my opinion on this issue .
Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there is currently no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious .
There is no text provided . Please provide the text you 'd like me to correct , and I 'll be happy to help !
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If a certain genetic disease test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to receive treatment and be known by others , it is okay to disclose the results .
Above all , life is more important than secrets .
Genetic risk carries its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
After all , what affects one family may or may not affect another , although the families have a common genetic makeup , shared by each of their parents .
In cases where an individual has come to know about a genetic disorder , disclosing it or not , to their relative is solely a matter of personal preference within their individual moral system .
The issue of whether to know or not to know is highly debatable , although it is a genetic risk ; one can not be entirely sure because the genetic information could possibly come from the families of either parent - his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts , or cousins .
This also means that as soon as a person is made aware of their genetic profile , they concurrently have knowledge about others .
This knowledge may be relevant to them , and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
Do people who suffer from this disease keep it a secret from their relatives ?
In retrospect , it 's also one 's duty to ensure that he or she undergoes periodic health checks on their own .
Sometimes , some family structures and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from - the son or daughter , for example - the parents who know about this would decide who gets told and who takes precedence in being " allowed " to tell .
For example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on that information to any offspring , whether they be adults or at - risk .
In addition , a woman who tests positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than doing it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information , as they may not want to know .
Hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so .
The notion of authority also extended vertically .
For example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even if she is not at genetic risk herself , whereas the aunt is .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct , they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non - blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to those who may benefit from such information and assist those at risk in making considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty it is to inform at - risk relatives or not greatly depends on the person 's moral compass and the nature of how directive the risk is to them .
People who have a close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry a genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his / her close relatives about the issue and let them know about the risk so that their family members are able to take some daily precautions to prevent the potential disease or they may go to the hospital and get checked for the corresponding tests .
In my opinion , although the announcement of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self - privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to inform their relatives so that they can take steps to prevent the potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Focus on the negative side of the announcement of genetic risk first .
Large numbers of patients with a genetic risk would want to keep it a secret because the genetic risk may indicate their high chance of carrying certain diseases .
Especially for young people who do not have marriage , if they know that someone in their family has a genetic risk , there may be a certain chance that their child could inherit the same disease , although this is not guaranteed .
Therefore , keeping the information a secret from his or her future spouse would help the relationship .
Secondly , announcing the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they might have some potential disease in the future , which would lead them to visit the hospital for additional checks or take extra medication to prevent the disease , and this creates unnecessary costs for the family .
Furthermore , the announcement of a genetic risk would affect the relationship with relatives , as sometimes others may think it best not to stay too close to the carrier , so that they have less chance of getting the potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extent and help to keep their privacy , it has much larger negative impacts on the family members and relatives .
First , in the case of marriage , people should be honest and tell their spouse that they may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offspring .
It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and a specific type of genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic diseases have a close relationship with the genes they are born with , as well as their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that they have a risk of having diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat fewer candies and chocolates to prevent excessive sugar intake , and at the same time , if the carrier tells this information to their relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may develop diabetes in the future because of related genes , and they can also perform the same exercise to reduce sugar intake to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties do not know , they may end up having diabetes in the future without any prevention .
In conclusion , we can conclude that the benefits of telling genetic risks to carriers ' relatives outweigh the costs .
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to inform the relatives , so that they can know and take preventative measures against the potential disease through regular exercise .
Among all kinds of different diseases , a large number of various disorders are caused by genetic factors .
Genetic disorders may or may not be inherited from a hereditary disease , and it can be difficult to determine if you have such diseases .
It has been a long - standing debate as to whether an individual who carries a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives that their disease is caused by a gene .
From a legal aspect , the answer is no ; however , from an ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
We can not make a law that requires a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform their relatives about their genetic condition .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , someone 's health issues belong to their own privacy .
Privacy protection belongs to one 's human rights .
If a law requires someone to reveal another person 's privacy , especially when that person is not willing to do so .
It is against his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit .
The law 's spirit also includes fairness .
What is the basic difference between genetic disorders and other disorders ?
It is unfair to release a law that only points to the genetic disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
A good law should be clear and easy to execute .
However , there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell their relatives the cause of their diseases .
Firstly , what is the range of relatives ?
For example , does the carrier only need to inform their direct relatives , such as parents , brothers , and sisters , or does he or she also need to inform relatives like the granddaughter of his grandmother 's sister 's son ?
If you say you only need to tell direct relatives , it would be against the fairness of the law .
Other relatives may also have the same possibility of having such a kind of disease .
How can a law made by the government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potential disease ?
However , from an ethical point of view .
To the carrier themselves , they should have a feeling of responsibility to tell their relatives about their genetic disorder .
By doing this , they may be able to save some lives of their relatives .
It is because a carrier with a bad gene may not necessarily have those genetic diseases ; if they can adopt corresponding healthy lifestyles before the age at which the gene 's function becomes stronger .
A typical example is genetic hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems that make it harder for the body to process fat and salt in the blood , which can lead to hypertension .
People usually get this kind of hypertension after they become an adult .
However , if they already know they have a gene that may make them more likely to get hypertension .
They can build a daily habit of eating less salt and fat , and thus avoiding hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society can not force someone who carries a genetic problem to tell their relatives about it , but they should be willing to inform their relatives about their genetic issue .
By doing so , fewer of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancements , many medical breakthroughs are made possible .
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo it .
It is able to detect illnesses or diseases , as well as a child 's parentage .
However , it will become a controversial issue as it poses a dilemma for an individual carrying a known genetic risk to inform their relatives .
If the knowledge of the genetic risk were to be shared within the family or relatives , there would be chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may take necessary precautions to prevent .
But , if it is a terminal disease , which is also a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon learning about it .
Therefore , some carriers may have the opinion of keeping it a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives or not .
Some say that the genetic risk found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered a personal piece of information that should be kept confidential .
Most patients will be depressed after realizing their condition .
If someone has a genetic disease after the test , they may not wish to inform their relatives , as it might end up disheartening their extended family .
Some may wish to keep it to themselves and hope to avoid bringing any pessimism into their family .
Furthermore , some people will wish not to become a burden on anyone , as seeking medical attention is relatively costly .
Hence , some see it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
On the other hand , others may think that it would be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency to get the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or take measures to prevent the risk of contracting the disease .
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic disease , given the context of current medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease , and it can be cured if it is detected in its early stages .
Hence , with the knowledge of having a genetic risk , the relatives of those affected by this genetic disease will undergo a medical check - up , which may help them realize it at an earlier stage .
In conclusion , it would be considerate to inform the relatives of the risk of getting the same genetic disease .
Although there may be a lot of challenges along the way when seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know their family 's inherited medical conditions .
However , some people think that it might be better for those who are unaware of it to lead a happy life .
In addition , some may think that even knowing about having a genetic risk for the disease will simply add to their misery , as there is nothing they can do about it .
All things considered , it depends on the individual and the nature of the disease , but they should be obligated to inform their relatives if there are possibilities of curing or preventing it .
Genetic testing is a personal decision , with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier or not .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk at all .
Early preparation for an examination is healthy because it will dispel unwanted doubts and affect the psychological state of those who are affected .
For a genetic risk carrier , there should be a choice given regarding informing his or her relatives .
There should not be forced or obligated to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and guide personal freedom of decision - making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then it is most likely that the decision to inform the relatives should be made with the consideration of the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
Such patients are still emotionally volatile , or they may be unaware of the consequences of such a genetic disorder due to their young age .
Furthermore , the act of informing others without the consent from either the parents or the patient itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , much thought needs to be put on the immediate family , as it could cause a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members themselves .
Some families may feel hurt , regarding their family pride or reputation , upon learning that a genetic disorder runs in their family .
However , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform one 's relatives since it is a genetic disorder .
There may be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of such genetic diseases is vital , as it may help to raise awareness and prevent the genetic disorder .
Also , this known information will help their relatives make informed decisions and similarly undergo genetic testing to find out about the outcome .
Thus , having the knowledge that such a genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotional thoughts .
And if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome , which will aid them in making upcoming decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it were made known to them .
Having support from relatives is vital because they ensure that the person who is a genetic risk carrier does not feel alone in facing this illness . It will certainly provide a moral boost , as the whole family shares a common sentiment regarding the future prospects of the genetic disorder , which could affect anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of such a genetic disorder will depend on the situation and background of the affected family , with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision to inform others .
A person with a disorder , regardless of whether it 's mental or physical , is always easily recognized by their family .
When things come to genetic issues , it 's not that simple anymore .
Genetic disorder inheritance is passed down from generation to generation , but not all offspring show the relevant symptoms .
Sometimes a family with a potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm within their bodies , as none of their members exhibit any observable disorder symptoms .
As a result , if one of the members happens to feel uncomfortable or abnormal , he or she should be aware that whether the disorder in their body is a genetic risk or not .
Afterwards , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not .
If the disorder 's symptoms affect a child , the parents will be informed by the medical staff for sure , and the whole family will remain alert to their condition .
On the contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has their own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself / herself , there is no doubt that they will tell their family about the issue .
That is true , and of course , it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of their family .
Think of it this way : if a child in the family knows that they have the risk of becoming a genetic risk carrier , and the risk may also be inherited by their own child in the future , their whole life will be in a dilemma .
And of course , he or she will think about not having children after getting married , and the same thought applies to their cousins as well .
As a result , the family 's generation comes to an end as soon as the adult carrier announces his death .
In China , the older generation with a traditional cultural background will always think that having more children as well as grandchildren can help make their family come alive and become stronger .
The reason behind this is that after World War II , the population of China decreased dramatically , and so the government encouraged the people to have more children .
During that period , if one of the family members reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fall into an ethical dilemma for sure .
The medical treatment technology at that time was not advanced enough to completely cure him .
He has to choose between protecting his family and making his family more prosperous at a potential generic risk .
And so , he would have chosen not to undergo general disorder testing , lest the truth remain buried forever .
This kind of ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and duties of the carrier within the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about the consequences of telling their relatives about their specific health issue .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform their relatives , but also an obligation for a family member to help enliven the family .
Regardless , if the disorder is rare enough to be non - fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it .
One of the reasons why is that , as a carrier , they need mental support to get through this situation .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own .
By telling their family , besides providing emotional support , they could possibly help her find alternative solutions to the problem she is currently facing .
Other than that , I believe that the strong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support for the carrier .
Furthermore , since it is a genetic problem , it would be better for the carrier to inform their family members , as other family members may also experience the same issue .
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check - up on themselves , and it would be better if they could even prevent it from happening to them .
I find it important to inform others if it is contagious ; the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading to the society .
For every action , there are always pros and cons .
I believe that some of the carriers may choose not to reveal their disease to their family members because they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even ostracized by them .
Furthermore , as it could incur significant expenses for the treatment , the carrier may not want to be a burden on her family .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in the family .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will occur when the carrier decides to tell their family about their condition .
In conclusion , personally , I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with their feelings and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on in their life .
If anything were to happen to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members , it could make a huge regret in their lives if she were to leave without them knowing about it .
On top of that , it 's better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members , as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that support in terms of both mental and monetary from your family could help the carrier fight against the genetic disease .
True enough , there are many cancer patients who were given a second chance to live a normal life as they have a strong mental support system from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong , we can fight any disease that comes to us when we are fragile and weak .
As technology has been advancing , it has reached a stage where its advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the actual use of the technology .
Genetic testing has made it possible ; it has become easy to determine whether one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness ; however , it could also make the situation worse by revealing who the carrier is within the family .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives . I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that he or she has a right not to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is optional .
Of course , some people may do it to make their future slightly happier ; however , the carrier , before taking the test , can choose not to take the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the fact .
If he chooses to live with the uncertainty that the gene holds and is willing to accept it , he could do so , and it has been something that is normal for everyone in the past , since genetic testing was not possible .
It would be better for him or her this way .
Some people might say that it is a form of preventing the birth of disabled individuals and sparing them from suffering in real life .
I personally think that this is the right purpose of going through genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled child does not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to oblige anyone else to tell , but it also has a responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemmas .
If the result turns out to be something that the carrier can not accept , then it would have been better not to know the truth .
I believe that even the carrier has the right not to know the true facts .
After realizing that they are the carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact and create more unhappiness within the family .
Overall , I believe that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face them with relatives , but he has no obligation to tell us still .
In fact , I strongly believe that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic test and take an appropriate action based on the results .
The emotional depression that a carrier might experience and the sense of guilt can be more than expected and could be a burden to one 's mind for the rest of their life .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome disability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy as it is , without experiencing emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing ; however , whether the results should be shared with others , especially close family members or relatives , is the topic worth discussing .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed , as a family - related ethical dilemma is involved .
In this essay , only a few arguments will be presented in support of the view that anyone carrying a known genetic risk should inform their relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , who welcomed us to this new world .
We were crying hard , but we 're not alone ; it 's our family and relatives who raised us .
Hence , we should be grateful to those people and we would like to share the joy with them .
However , in the case of any health issue or serious disorder , it may seem that there is no point in sharing ; but this involves more than just sharing bad news .
One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
As the case of a health issue is related to genetic risk , with a focus on ' genetic ' which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I would agree that it is obligatory for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform their relatives about avoiding any potential family - related ethical dilemmas that could arise in the future .
Despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such a health issue or to bear it within themselves , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives for a proper discussion about solutions .
By doing so , one will feel less stressed when facing such risks .
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more care towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting against the battle of such disorderly risks .
On top of that , since the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , it will involve more than just one family .
It is therefore that I would agree on the obligation of informing the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and having a plan for giving birth .
This would help to avoid the rise of more family - related ethical dilemmas .
There are more intangible advantages that could support the stance of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test has been conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family - related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of a known genetic risk to inform their relatives .
The original text remains unchanged :
More support systems need to be put in place through various channels to provide clearer guidance for individuals who find themselves at a crossroads , deciding whether they should inform their relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is a common law in society .
However , it leads to a new problem : Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is still a diversity of viewpoints among the people .
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue , whether one should or should not .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the following sentence : " I will be anxious about my family when he or she tells me that they are a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Frequently , the intention of the carriers is not to tell their families that they want to continue their own lives without worrying about their families .
It is obvious that it is better for one person to be less worried than many .
However , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges themselves .
With the family 's support , there must be more energy to fight against the demon .
Demon is not easily defeated , and it requires a lot of energy and psychological support .
Families provide you with the courage and support that you can not retrieve by yourself .
That is the most essential element to overcome the challenges .
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic condition is very serious and can not be described .
The seriousness can be larger than our imagination .
Lying on the bed for the remainder of my life , or dying immediately , these are the consequences that we can not imagine .
Families are dear to us in our lives .
Without their concern and support , we would be hard - pressed to get through this time .
They play an important role in our lives that can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to inform the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesirable consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's family without the carrier 's agreement .
It is the ethics of the staff at the hospital to keep secrets about any patient .
We can not blame them for being liable to undesirable consequences .
However , hospitals can provide a counselor to advise the carrier on the actions that can be taken .
Therefore , such circumstances will not happen again .
It 's a method that benefits two parties , which is a win - win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be some special cases that are hard to define .
Thus , advice from hospitals plays an important role in this .
Carriers are responsible for balancing their own interests and the benefits of their families and society .
It is a hard decision to make , but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for carriers and their families in the future .
With the risk of being genetically predisposed , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing .
With the knowledge that the results will be known once the tests are complete , each individual who is diagnosed as a genetic risk carrier faces an ethical dilemma : they should warn their relatives about the risk of being the same genetic risk carrier .
They can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed .
In my opinion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform their relatives , with the support of the following reasons .
First of all , from the angle of human rights , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of protection for carriers .
They may not want this truth to influence their lives or want to keep it a secret and do n't want others to know about it .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth about being a carrier may make them be discriminated against or sympathized by others , which is not positive factors brought into their life .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing , regardless of the diagnosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about this .
If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility .
However , if a diagnosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being at genetic risk as carriers .
This obeys its own willingness , as it has to accept the truth , which may make their future life miserable .
Many people argue that setting an obligation may help more people , who are relatives of the carriers , save their lives by providing a larger opportunity due to early diagnosis .
However , this is not exactly true when other factors , including psychological influence and social influence , are taken into account .
If one such relative is told that they may have a higher risk of getting sick , they may become scared about the unknown future , partners , spouses , and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may arise , which could mean the relative 's life may be ruined .
On the other side , as stated above , a person who wants to confirm and has been prepared to face the results can choose to do the genetic testing individually .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not .
This should be accepted as a fundamental human right , encompassing freedom of acceptance and including relatives , as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restrict the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
For an individual who carries a genetic disorder to know that they are a carrier causes more dilemma than actually getting the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
There are four reasons why people do not have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and their family can take precautions , both physically through actions and mentally , to reduce the chances of its being inherited by offspring , and if the action fails to prevent it from being inherited .
Many syndromes , such as Down syndrome and Tay - Sachs syndrome , can be prevented from happening if the mother undergoes proper medical treatment and does not consume harmful substances during the pregnancy period .
This information may not be known to the mother if she does not tell her relatives about her condition .
More people who know her problem , more information channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome , then the family must accept this fact and do whatever they can to create a good environment for their children 's growth .
This is not the parents ' fault because there is still a chance of the gene being inherited .
So , they also need to prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases can cost highly for their treatment and medication .
Albinism is one example .
The people with albinism have sensitive skin , and it requires regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their bodies well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen outdoors , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer .
Once you have suffered from cancer , the cost of the medication can be very expensive .
To prevent a bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does not tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sickle - cell trait .
Usually , people are not aware that they carry the sickle cell gene , which may lead to circulatory problems such as blood clotting .
If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives , then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do not need to be shy about it , as it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Furthermore , it is important for parents to provide emotional support for their children with a genetic disorder .
When their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise .
People and friends often make fun of your circumstances .
A strong mental condition and conviction must be built from within and from those closest to you .
If it 's not their family , then who else is willing to do that ?
It 's not a heavy job for the family if they have prepared themselves mentally by discussing the information about the probability that their children may suffer from a genetic disorder .
In this modern world , technology has improved significantly compared to the last century .
Particularly , in the medical field , there has been a great improvement in many treatments for many formerly incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods that is used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder .
The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family - related ethical dilemma arises .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about it .
This is because their relatives have the right to know about this .
As many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives ; that is , if one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder , it means that other family members also have almost an equal risk of having it . So , this problem should be taken seriously by the family .
Every family member has their human right to know what is going on about them .
If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , then how can this explain their rights ?
For instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder , but he does not tell his sibling , James , about this .
Although telling James about this may be horrible to some extent , he should know what will likely be happening to him .
This might be beneficial for him in the future if he is aware of the risks associated with having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having a similar genetic disorder , which prevents certain genetic disorders from affecting them .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement in medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves .
In addition , doctors usually quote a statement , ' Prevention is better than cure ' ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder from happening has far more advantages than curing it .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for that person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of that disorder possible .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are aware that they have such a disorder can prevent it from happening by adopting a healthy lifestyle , which includes having a balanced diet and exercising for at least 30 minutes every day .
To summarize , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to inform their relatives .
This is their human right to know about that , and it may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from happening .
Together with the advancement of technology over the past decades , medical advancements have increased exponentially , and further enhancements are still constantly being upgraded . Empowering doctors with advanced medical knowledge , they are able to diagnose and conduct genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their lives . However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a question arises as to whether to disclose the results to his or her relatives , which becomes a challenging issue for both the patient and the doctor . In my opinion , I strongly believe that it is essential to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .
As it is a genetic risk , the patient 's next of kin may have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions can be taken before unforeseen circumstances may occur . For example , if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately , you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait may be passed on to your next generation if you have a child ; hence , by letting your family members know about the situation , it would lessen family stress and suffering , and prevent you from feeling forced to settle down and have children .
However , there are still people against the decision of revealing private information . As in the case of Alzheimer 's patients , it is ultimately up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information . However , research has shown that doctors have tried to determine who , how , and to whom Alzheimer 's disease should be disclosed to minimize the potential negative impact on family members ( Dementia Today , 2012 ) .
In conclusion , the state should pass a legal bill to inform doctors how far they should go in revealing genetic diseases to relatives and under what circumstances it is up to the patient 's discretion . Additionally , the state could also encourage the creation of assistance programs to provide necessary support to needy patients , thereby encouraging them to be more forthcoming about their condition for the benefit of themselves and their family members . Although this may encounter challenges related to social ethics , in the long run , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would likely develop a different perspective on acceptance and take appropriate measures to protect their own health and that of their loved ones .
Recently , the study in the field of genetics has made significant progress due to rapid technological advancements .
Not long ago , the Human Genome Project , sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) , was started .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , since the technology has been very mature already , another even more popular topic arises .
While most people agree that each individual has their own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stances on whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the results with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , patients who are carriers of some known genetic risks should share the truth with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the lives of others .
To the entire society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example , all people in Singapore , including students at school , travelers at Changi Airport , workers in the office , as well as passengers on the street , are required by law to take their temperature and report the results to the relevant government authority in charge .
To those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones into danger ?
The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other without any doubts .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a group of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to inform their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder , both as a social responsibility and a favor to preserve the family 's heritage .
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , a patient 's life is no better than death .
Family members , being one of the closest groups of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully overcome any possible troubles resulting from a genetic disorder .
A study at New York University in 2010 showed that patients with family members nearby generally recover 2 - 4 days faster than those cared for by professional nurses .
Even for those patients with terminal illnesses , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth can sometimes give rise to unnecessary doubts and panic , which may endanger family harmony .
While every family needs to go through some kind of troublesome situation , the more troubles a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between family members , as well as the greater amount of trust , love , and understanding .
Hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in one another and loving one another , all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
Just like the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , ' what does n't kill you makes you stronger .
Being in an Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I believe that it is the patient 's choice whether they want to tell their relatives about their disease .
The courage to take genetic testing and informing one 's relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental ; however , it is just a risk and not a confirmed case .
Furthermore , since it is their gene that is affected , they have the right to determine with whom they want to share the information with .
Nevertheless , while I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest that the person shares this information with their potential partner ( husband or wife ) , as the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children .
Many people in our society are not well - informed about many genetic diseases , and many of them may likely judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases because they feel that the patients are abnormal or " weird " .
This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as bubble boy disease , autism , or Down syndrome .
In those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic disorder .
While we do know that we should not discriminate against them based on their limitations , many people still do it , often without even realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell their relatives about his having a risk of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to demand fair and equal treatment , like everyone else , and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues private , in case some people judge them or treat them differently . Many people tend to only listen to what they want to hear , and so they may simply ignore the risk and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent this from happening , I believe it is up to the individual whether they want to share the information with their family , as their family may either be paranoid or judgmental and react differently .
Especially when it 's just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to inform family members about the risk , as some of them may be affected . While I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a consideration .
Maybe we can trust our immediate family members , but can we really trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is ultimately up to the individual 's discretion to decide whether or not to inform their relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least inform their potential future partner about the potential risk to their future family , since their genetic risk may affect their children later .
This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
There may be possibilities where both the husband and wife are carriers , and therefore they should not have any children , as their child may not be able to survive even after birth .
Or , in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled .
This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters ; therefore , although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to share it with their future partner .
In conclusion , whether or not the carrier wishes to inform his relatives about his genetic risk , the choice is his , as it is his own gene and he has the full right to do so .
He may have different considerations other than those due to the fear of being judged by others or may result in making his family worry unnecessarily when thinking about whether he should tell his relatives . No matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it , and we have no right to say that he must tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is priceless , and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the advancements of technology , a new life with a genetic risk can be detected .
Genetics refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore , an entirely new dilemma is born : Should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have a genetic risk .
One of the reasons why parents should be informed is that they must decide whether they are capable of raising a child with a genetic risk .
The child with a genetic risk may not have the ability to work , build up the family like others , and most of the time they are not accepted by the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy what normal people can enjoy .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives often have to work longer than expected and tirelessly to help foster their child if he or she is unable to care for himself or herself .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy burden named medical expenses .
Not only the child , but also the entire family will suffer .
It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life when they are not able to work and may suffer the pain throughout their entire lives .
The other reason that parents should know whether their baby is a carrier of a genetic risk is for the greater good of the nation .
There are always reports in the newspaper that a newborn baby has been abandoned at the hospital after they realize the baby has diseases that require a huge amount of money to treat .
For countries like Singapore , they are short on manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year the government has to spend a lot to help people with disabilities , such as providing medical subsidies and building special schools to educate them .
Without an increase in the number of people with disabilities in a nation , the government is able to focus on developing in other areas such as military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways .
Moreover , in the world we live in today , many miscarriages that occur in hospitals every day .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
Therefore , I believe that parents have the right to know the health status of their child .
Many people may support the theory that everyone has their right to enjoy the world , especially those with religious beliefs .
However , the problem is that will the people really enjoy their lives if they have to stay at the hospital every day and endure all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what 's best for their children , so they will make the right decision once they are informed .
Also , humans should improve the medical field in order to prevent tragedies from happening .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
One should have full control over their information , and it is their right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else .
As far as I am concerned , when a couple is going to have a baby , they will run a few tests to see if they might be at risk for having some genetic diseases .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wives .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason for those who argue in favor of this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling them the results can help them largely reduce the cost of multiple tests .
They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
If someone has a disease C that may be a result of gene A.
He runs a test and knows that he has the gene AA .
This means both of his parents have the gene A , and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see if they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and knows that he has the gene A or aa .
This means that one of his parents has gene A , and one cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can then take measures , if it can somehow be prevented , to prevent this disease from taking their lives .
However , this can also be achieved through personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives ; if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume that most of them would tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to hint or encourage certain relatives to take a genetic test if they are concerned about the negative consequences that may come across when they disclose their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that those who may face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obliged to tell their relatives , they might be discriminated against by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might even be advised not to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has genes Aa and gene aa is sufficient to cause a very serious disease .
After he takes the test , he will be obligated to tell his relatives , and everyone will know that he is a carrier .
So all the married couples go to take a test and know they are not carriers . They might subconsciously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will also be a carrier .
Third , it is difficult to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family , one of the family members tests positive , who does he need to tell ?
If it 's a big family , is he obligated to tell everyone ?
Spouses usually have very close relationships . If person A tells his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needs to run a test because his cousin has this disease .
However , my wife is not even under the risk of having this disease .
Then my wife might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theater .
In less than a week , half of the town will know that Person A has a risk gene , and his family may be a genetically predisposed family .
Then , nobody wants to marry him , or his relatives .
This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control over their information , especially when the party that they are obliged to disclose their information to is a potentially large group of relatives .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Carriers of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell their relatives .
Today , people not only pursue the comfort of their own lives but also the better development of their future generations .
Since the technology of modern society has become so advanced , it makes it possible for people to make decisions to take genetic tests to determine whether or not they carry genetic risks that could affect their next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is whether people are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
There are two basic reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your own well - being and the health of your relatives , and the second one is being responsible for the next generation .
The awareness of your relatives ' and families about your genetic risk is good for your own well - being and the health of your relatives .
Because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is a great possibility that your relatives , such as parents or siblings , are also carrying the same genetic risk as well .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you at risk .
If you have n't undergone genetic testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives .
However , if you know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your entire family .
Even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to have the checks done regularly .
Therefore , it is your responsibility to tell the families and relatives to prepare themselves for fighting the disease and to prevent getting the disease .
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generation by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and gives birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well .
As a parent , you are not responsible for your next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed down from generation to generation , and being aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you give them a choice about whether to have a child or not .
And if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has become so advanced , it may be possible in the future that the application of gene alteration is perfected and widely used ; you can then choose to give birth to babies who will have a brighter future .
This is the responsibility of being a parent .
And in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing genetic testing in the first place .
As a conclusion , once you have undergone genetic testing and become aware of carrying some specific genetic risks , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and future generations by telling your relatives and family members the truth .
To tell or not to tell
Consider a case : we decide to undergo genetic testing , and then learn the results .
We found that we are actually genetic risk carriers .
Then it becomes troublesome to consider whether we need to inform our relatives who may also carry this genetic risk .
There are really a lot of things that we need to consider .
Every choice we make may have a huge impact on their whole life .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep it a secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives because we really care about their health status .
For example , diabetes is a type of genetic disease .
Once we found that we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may also carry it as well .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits , such as eating less sugary foods and maintaining a good mood .
It is important for those young people .
The earlier we tell them , the better it will be for the rest of their lives .
What 's more , they may undergo genetic testing as well to see whether they are carrying it or not , which is also better for them .
However , some people may argue that why do we want to interfere with their lives ?
Sometimes it becomes extremely difficult for them to accept this news , especially if they are going to learn that they or their descendants may have a severe disease , such as a blood disorder that is untreatable .
Imagine you are living like a normal person , but suddenly one day your relative comes and tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some diseases in the future . What kind of feelings would you have ?
It may affect our daily lives , and we will think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we can not focus on anything .
At the same time , there may also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct , which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this issue , so actually , we are causing unnecessary trouble for them .
Personally , I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them about the situation .
Since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is to try to make it so in a positive way .
We can not let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make their own correct choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them that they will start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to have a child due to this genetic problem and will start finding ways to try to prevent their future child from inheriting this genetic risk as well .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
Maybe after we tell them , they will consider going for it and learn more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should realize that they are our loved ones ; we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell .
Genetic testing will be conducted when an individual is at risk of developing some possible disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be made available to his or her relatives has caused significant social controversy .
Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy , and that it should be protected .
He or she has the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform their relatives about their actual situation .
This essay will discuss two aspects .
First of all , it can serve as an alert to the family members of the patient , letting them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass on their genes to their family members .
Once one person in the family is found to be carrying a risky genetic mutation , other members of his or her family may also have the risk of developing the disease .
Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough .
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment .
Sometimes , life may even be saved if they are told early and receive timely treatment .
So , for the sake of the other family members , the relatives should be informed .
Secondly , it can also avoid genetic diseases that are passed on to the next generation if they intend to have children .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before getting married .
They need to ask for a doctor 's advice before planning to have a baby .
Some genetic genes will pass only to boys rather than girls ; others are , however , passed on to both .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to their spouse , another life may be at risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a real story in a newspaper many years ago .
A couple in China has a five - year - old son .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and was diagnosed with a kind of genetic disease that is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family carried the polygenic disorder and could pass it only to boys rather than girls .
Therefore , his son inherited the genetic disease .
However , the wife had actually known about the polygenic disorder before the marriage , and she did not tell her husband .
The son passed away after one year 's treatment , and the couple got divorced later as a result .
If the wife had n't hidden the truth and sought a doctor 's advice before having a baby , the tragedy would n't have happened .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , it can inform members of the carrier 's family about the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if necessary .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Today , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing .
We can not deny that genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face a disorder problem .
However , I think that genetic information is one person 's personal privacy , which should be protected by law .
Therefore , I think that a person with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives .
There are three reasons as follows .
Firstly , the information concerning genetics is something personal , which is also a matter of privacy , just like people 's bank card keys .
Other people should not be told without the person 's permission , even if they are his or her family or relatives .
The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy .
Once someone 's genetic information is shared with others .
They may know the person 's potential disability or other adverse conditions naturally .
They may set a bias against this person , even if he or she abandons them .
People do not have the ability to choose their genes ; they should not be judged harshly because of a bad genetic makeup .
So , I think , regardless of what the genetics are or whether the genes match those of their parents , it should not be disclosed to anyone , including their family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may disrupt the peace of a family , breaking the relationship between children and adults .
Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them .
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier that would appear , which would truly destroy the family gradually .
The relationship between parents and their children should not be tested solely in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and more intimate .
The parents give knowledge and love to their children , and they feel happy with the company of their children .
The children rely on their parents to live .
When they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank them for their dedication .
The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication .
Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , I think that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Finally , the technology for testing genes is not yet very mature .
There also exists some possibility of incorrect testing .
If the wrong test results were not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a difficult life for their whole lifetime .
Therefore , I think that a person who knows their genetic risk should not be obligated to tell their family or relatives .
Therefore , considering the importance of people 's privacy and the existence of wrongful testing , for the sake of the family 's peace , I believe that an individual with a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform their family or relatives without the person 's consent .
A carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
More and more illnesses are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have had the genetic test .
If there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
However , not everyone is so lucky that they can not carry any disease genes .
Therefore , once people find that they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible for telling their relatives , at least their family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But they are all from one family and own the same ancestor , then of course they share the same genes to some extent .
Therefore , there is nothing to be shy about or afraid of .
If someone tells their relatives that they carry a disease gene , their relatives can go to the hospital to check whether they also carry a disease gene .
Then , the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring .
Also , they can prevent the disease from affecting their offspring .
If the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share their experience with him or her and offer some help . They will also teach him or her how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or she does not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that they carry a disease gene .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctor 's .
Otherwise , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have an unhealthy baby , which could lead to the death of the baby or the end of their marriage .
There is a story that I watched on television .
A couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time ; their parents were anxious about this and asked them to visit the hospital to determine what was the problem .
After returning from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carries a disease gene , so they can not have a baby in their lifetime .
The woman did not know the test results , but she overheard the conversation and decided to get a divorce from her husband .
After receiving the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it stated that the woman carried the disease gene instead of him .
At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her , but she ruined her happiness .
Tears showed nothing .
People can not avoid carrying the disease genes that they were born with .
However , they can avoid passing on the disease genes to their children .
By telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family members bond more closely , and many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder .
However , there arises a family - related ethical dilemma as to whether it is right to inform a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am most inclined to believe that their relatives have the right to know the results .
The answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
Although it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , even though the potential negative impacts of these risks still exist , the consequences would be significant if other members of his or her family were not aware .
Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves from emotional preparations .
Taking Angelina Jolie as an example , she is famous ; however , she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk .
Everything is n't that bad if you know how to look on the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results .
In some cases , a carrier can suffer from tension within a family because the result is also related to the other 's risk somehow .
However , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation .
In addition , although it may be possible in some cases for him or her and the family to undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , people can face more dramatic tragedies such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation .
Life is hard , but people can not blame it on being unfair .
It 's just because you do n't become strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially when the situations of other relatives worsen ; at that point , you should feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever ; but when it is revealed , even more shocking and upsetting it will be .
As a result , it is in the interest of the carriers and their relatives that telling the genetic testing results is necessary .
Last but not least , although genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the results to your family can improve and develop an understanding and sympathy among each other , as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
That play 's an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of society and anxiety about the risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have an obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing results for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult for them , but necessary for the carriers and their families .
In addition , making emotional preparations and explaining your genetic condition clearly is also important , so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives , and if necessary , guide them if they wish to conduct a similar genetic test .
The Impact Of Social Media
Social media has been playing a vital role in our lives today .
It is almost impossible for us to keep away from it .
I started using Facebook one year ago when I just arrived in Singapore .
And now I have over 500 friends on Facebook and bury myself with hundreds of seeds every day .
We know each other 's status , changes , and so on through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we will no longer send SMS to each individual .
Instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform them of these kinds of changes .
And if you 're not on it , you 'll just get lost .
In certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
It is becoming even more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free .
We discuss everything we like , and we have more personal space . Our friends also get more access to know what we 're doing and what we like .
And also , we have a chance to talk to public figures like popular stars and learn more about their lives .
In China , many government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , such as firefighters , police stations , and so on .
Social media allows them to explain to or inform people about what is going on .
And actually , many rescue jobs are done with the help of social media , such as looking for people who are lost , and so on .
With more convenient and humanitarian communications , the relationship between government and people gets largely improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be showcased to us through social media .
We can learn more about news and cultures through social media .
From this perspective , social media has shortened our distance .
However , we have less chance and less importance to talk face - to - face since social media is so convenient , advanced , and interesting .
And even when we gather together , many people find themselves having fewer topics to talk about than before , and they choose to dig through their social media again .
When we are far away , social media makes it feel like we 're together in front of each other ; sometimes when we 're side by side , we seem to be closer than when we 're actually far apart .
This kind of feeling makes people 's relationships less stable , secure , and reliable than they were before .
Besides , there are more people showing their pictures of yummy food or traveling experiences .
To some extent , this makes our life more luxurious and enjoyable .
For myself , I am longing for some places after I saw those beautiful pictures taken by my friends .
Sometimes I even can not sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our lives pattern so fast and leaves us less time to think about our lives .
Social media is becoming increasingly important , and we need to think more critically about how to make it serve us even better .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skill , require practice .
Besides that , these skills require time to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning of social media definitely has its benefits ; but among all good things , it is better to have them in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , any information can be readily available for their perusal .
This improves the connectivity between the users .
For example , one is able to send notifications and other information that we used to have in hard copy previously , over the web , and the process takes only seconds .
The recipient will then receive the information almost immediately , depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived as almost in real - time .
Next , communication is also greatly improved .
In the past , vast communications were done through one of the many methods , including telegrams , snail mail , and poor - quality voice calls .
With the advent of applications like Skype and FaceTime , anyone can phase out most of the old - fashioned communication methods .
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcam could also be affixed to emulate a " real " interaction with expressions and gestures .
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media .
However , it is a good practice not to use social media excessively all the time .
Intimate interaction greatly lacks in social media interactions , particularly in terms of physical touch .
Having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recipient .
It involves a level of dynamic interaction that utilizes the motor , thinking , and verbal cortices of the mind to coordinate .
Unlike the use of social media , most of the interaction is done through thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not necessarily train for the essential parts of the skills required for proper interpersonal relationships .
It is also entirely incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Gardner studied the effects of multiple intelligences among people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of intelligence in itself ; some people have it , while others do not .
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance with utilizing tests , and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who score lower on rankings for interpersonal skills are more likely to struggle when this skill is needed .
Although social media does not have to be inherently bad , it must be used appropriately for work , family , and friends .
The types of use must also be taken into account , including informing , interacting , discussing , and others .
The space of separation between the parties must also be looked at .
For people who are living very far apart from each other , the intense use of social media is justified .
For those who live within the community should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communication with each other .
And at the same time , it improves interpersonal skills through dynamic practices between individuals and real - time presence .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring about a better rapport between those interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media has helped people to have a closer connection with each other . It is a more convenient and cost - effective way to maintain online contact compared to face - to - face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chances for people to have face - to - face contact , and therefore will not negatively impact interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may even increase the chances of having face - to - face contact among people .
First , social media networks have a large user base ; it helps to connect people from different parts of the world .
In the days before social networks , people may not have had the chance to know others from different countries or those they had never met before .
Their number of people that they know may be limited to the people they meet in their daily life , such as classmates and working partners .
Therefore , social networks bring more and more connections between people , and they may have a chance to chat with people they had never known before ; this helps to develop their interpersonal skills as well .
Secondly , although social networks take time for people to chat online rather than face - to - face , they may still decide on a specific time online to meet others face - to - face in their daily lives .
In this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of their talks .
For example , if a social network did not exist , businesspeople would need to meet each other face - to - face , and it would be another time - consuming process , even for businesses that are not particularly important ; it would still take up a lot of time on travel , which would be a waste .
However , social networks help people to meet and chat much more easily ; they can even use video chat and create group chats to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Today , even some companies conduct online video interviews with their applicants , as it saves time and costs .
The social network may also create some negative impacts on the people .
The largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on the internet every minute .
They take too much time using online social networks and therefore do not have time to have their daily meetings with people in their real lives .
It not only affects interpersonal skills but also has negative effects on people 's health when individuals spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may leak certain personal information to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not entirely safe ; people may not protect their privacy online effectively , and sometimes , some individuals may use other people 's personal information to deceive .
In conclusion , despite the unsafe online environment , spending too much time on the internet may be one of the potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It provides people with a more convenient contact environment and improves the frequency of meetings with one another .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chatting .
Overall , there are more benefits than the costs .
The world is increasingly becoming flatter by all kinds of social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter .
We can even know what a friend who lives thousands of miles away eats for lunch through these kinds of social media .
From some points of view , social media really has a lot of advantages because it lets us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently .
However , its disadvantages can not be ignored when you consider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cybercrime .
Social networking sites provide us with many conveniences .
Without hanging out with friends or talking to friends on the phone , we can know their latest news by scanning the webpage .
It can help us know more about each other .
It can also make people become closer .
For example , if you find out that one of your friends ' favorite singer is Justin Bieber through Facebook , you can give them his or her Justin Bieber 's new album or concert tickets as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet , and you two will surely become closer .
In addition , social networking sites can help you keep in touch with friends who live very far away .
I met some Canadian friends in Egypt .
Without Facebook , we might lose contact .
However , thanks to Facebook , I can still keep in touch with them , and I know what they 're doing recently because we live close to each other .
Original text : " The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable .
A study shows that people will unconsciously hide their real thoughts when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can not know another 's real thoughts and personality by reading what they post on social networking media .
It will make them quite upset when they communicate in real life .
In addition , with all those ' nice ' guys around on the social networking website , one may neglect the people surrounding them , but instead choose to only communicate with friends on Facebook .
It 's a common scene where two people sitting next to each other rarely talk to each other , but instead look at their cellphones .
This kind of behavior is not good for people 's psychological health , according to research .
The cyber communication is quite different from face - to - face communication , and people who depend too much on cyber communication may not get used to real - life communication .
In addition , a cyber relationship can not always work in real life .
With no close relationships in real life but only online friendships , one is more likely to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel a sense of connection with others through our five senses .
With the willingness of people to be the best among others , social networking sites have now become a place to showcase oneself .
Some people like to post about their expensive trips or interesting places they 've been to on social media and get a sense of satisfaction from doing so .
It is a mental health issue and it may trigger people , especially teenagers , to become materialistic .
The last , but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is convenient for criminals to make use of this information to commit a crime .
Above all , a social networking site is like a double - edged sword , and people can only take full advantage of it by avoiding its potential disadvantages , such as posting minimal personal information on their Facebook page .
The modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common in contemporary society ; and people can communicate with each other , either online or offline , on these social networking platforms .
They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will enable them to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites has reduced physical human interactions among people , as they would rather sit in front of a computer than go out and meet new friends .
This essay will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media is able to disseminate information faster than any other medium .
There are about 50 percent of the people who have learned about breaking news from social media .
This is due to people spending significantly more time on social networking than they do on reading newspapers .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to gain access to social media sites , which have made it easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediately to the people around them .
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated is reliable .
There may be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb that had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and as a result , schools were temporarily closed .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information at a relatively fast speed .
Nevertheless , there are cybersecurity policies that roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes from spreading around .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites , despite high security measures to control almost every social networking movement .
Social media can help improve relationships and make new friends , as long as there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends , and it would take relatively a long time to send the letter .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other conveniently .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends who have similar interests or hobbies .
However , in order for people to maintain their relationships as well as make new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It may not be accurate to judge another person 's feelings over social media , as one may cover up their emotions while on social media .
In addition , there are also opportunities for people to miscommunicate with each other because they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication .
But , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve their relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in today 's society is able to help one improve relationships and make new friends , as well as disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and a chance of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of .
All things considered , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement , and there 's more to come in the future .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly eased long - distance communication and interaction due to their accessibility and convenience .
With a globalized and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platforms for social interaction .
With just a touch away from any media or electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with their friends without much hassle .
Thus , maintaining a long - distance relationship or friendship has become much easier , as keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much simpler .
With the sharing of personal photos , posting of one 's personal feelings or experiences , and being able to reply to these posts allows for human interaction to be engaged and expanded with ease .
Introverts or those who are shy about communicating with their friends can now do so in the form of words through social media platforms .
Thus , socialization can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilization of such social media platforms . Meetups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience .
The society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interactions are being transformed into cyber interactions .
With the frequent use and reliance on social media and the internet , a society that socializes through cyberspace will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns when using a social media platform to communicate is credibility .
The certainty of what is being shared or expressed can not be proven physically , as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat .
We can not be certain about the reliability or truth of some posts or information we receive through the Internet .
We may actually be communicating with a hoax Facebook account of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real , but in reality , it is a fake account .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agendas .
Thus , the lack of face - to - face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction , which can be stimulated by the media .
Although emojis can be used to show certain emotions , this differs from the real , authentic emotion of your friends when you observe them through their body language and facial expressions .
The danger of such socialization through media is the uncertainty of communication due to the lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human interpersonal behavior , as communication is now made through social media rather than meet - ups .
This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another , which can adversely affect one 's behavior .
The lack of exposure to real - life interaction with humans will not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance between both social media interaction and face - to - face human interaction among its people .
Today , people can even use their phones to read the news , and everyone can be one of the first witnesses of what 's happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artist or celebrity they love , and Facebook to see what 's their recent activity .
Nevertheless , they can still use their phones to make normal calls and send messages to contact .
Not only did the phone do the job for them , but also devices like personal computers , laptops , tablets , and many other devices that can connect to the internet .
It is obvious to see that the internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding the social media 's inevitable disadvantages for people .
People can only use electrical devices to access the internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use either a phone or the internet .
Generally , people need their eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
As a result , they will lose eye contact and hands to express their feelings to people near them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face - to - face communication .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays .
A family of four had dinner in a restaurant without any conversation , as they were each holding and gazing at their mobile phone screens with one hand while using the other to hold a fork .
A group of friends having high tea in a café without chatting as well , because they do n't know what to talk about , but instead are pressing on their phone screens .
The children these days do not know what neighborhood games are or who is staying beside them ; all they know is pressing icons on their screens .
These are some concrete examples of how social media can reduce face - to - face human contact .
When people get used to using social media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will deteriorate and may be lost eventually .
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers ; not even the courage to talk .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate effectively with people face - to - face and will not be trained in their conversation skills .
As a result , social media helps them do their jobs , but it also indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media does have some other advantages besides their general benefits to human beings .
First of all , people save money by using the internet to contact other people and read news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via social media software instead of making an international call , which costs a lot for a normal salary family .
He can even talk to her daughter face - to - face using a video call via the internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and are able to update their friends on their recent activities easily .
A guy who is going to travel for months can easily tell all his friends about his plans .
When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he may be able to find out his whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that usually work most of the time .
In conclusion , social media benefits people in several ways , but at the same time it also harms people .
People should avoid the misuse of social media and use it in the proper way .
With the aid of social media , people bond globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives become happier .
All of us are living in the technological society .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect us with others ?
It started with the invention of technology , which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades .
In the past , we traveled by ship ; now we can use an airplane to do so .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message because we had to post our letter . Now , however , we can use email , which stands for electronic mail , to send messages to our friends , or even use our handheld phone to send our messages .
From the example I mentioned earlier , we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones is getting farther apart .
This is because of the ease of technology , such as air travel , some of our friends may be going overseas to continue their studies or you may be away from your family to pursue your studies or career in life .
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the media that we need .
Nevertheless , everything in life has both positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to those social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in touch and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends , even if we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
This approach helps parents to communicate with their children and know what kinds of activities their children are doing while they are overseas .
The social media is beneficial because it connects you and your loved ones even when you are separated by distance .
It may not be able to replace the joy that you feel when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned at the beginning , there are also disadvantages to social media tools .
One of the reasons is that it reduces the level of concentration , especially among the young people .
This is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their Facebook page , as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse Facebook while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concentrating when they are supposed to do so .
As a result , it could affect their lives and their studies .
This may then lead to stress , as these students are unable to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own life by making the right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using social media sites ; however , in this case , striking a balance between social media and one 's life is the most important thing to do .
Today , the use of social media platforms is a common place in our lives .
In an increasingly globalized world , such platforms even enhance and complicate the links between individuals in the world .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing about some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real - world , resulting in some negative impacts on individuals ' daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in society as a whole .
As people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face - to - face human contact has decreased .
As people feel more confident online , where they do n't have to face it in real life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and therefore prefer communicating online .
This result in a lack of interpersonal skills in individuals , especially among young students , as they often have the option to turn their backs on real life and go online .
This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life .
As they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their sense of self - identity in real life and may not realize how to interact with people in real life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into social media , they seek attention from their friends .
However , such sparks of sudden attention are extremely short - term and quickly gone ; therefore , they do not add any value or meaning to the user 's life .
Also , according to research , it has been proven that users feel more sad after using Facebook , which is because users unknowingly compare their lives with others ' lives .
But seriously , most people only post the happiest moments from their lives .
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make users stay connected among the people .
Indeed , I use Facebook because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
However , the friendship in such a virtual world is so superficial , which is not very relevant to real life .
Also , as numerous profit - driven companies realize the huge human traffic on such social media sites , they make it their pond to fish for customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this may also trigger privacy issues because Facebook allows some other profit - driven companies to have access to the user 's information .
As this happens , users are becoming increasingly prone to any possible frauds .
Social media sites are at their peak at the moment ; however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better people in real life , they will not be indulging in it as much as they are now .
The users will soon realize that they do n't need such social media sites to stay in touch with their friends because , if they really need someone , they will reach out to their friends no matter what .
We think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected - or are we falling apart ?
Social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter were born with the intention of connecting people from around the world .
The idea seems great , and nowadays , most people , including the older generation , will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
The parents are now the " friends " of their children , and they can now " keep track " of their children more closely and in real - time .
People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , in order to stay connected with their so - called friends .
However , as we tend to spend too much time on this , we have significantly reduced our face - to - face human contact , which eventually affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using such social media in my daily life .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and at different settings .
We may meet only once , but we exchange our contact numbers as well as Facebook accounts in order to stay in touch .
Unlike simply keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media , such as Facebook , is a great way for friends from different fields or even from different parts of the world to stay connected .
Within a click , we could check on the friend 's profile and read through their updates .
On the other hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read about it on the news feed .
This allows friends who may not have the time for a meetup to still stay connected in some way .
Not only that , new friends can be easily made through such online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to bind us together can also be the cause that drives us apart .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the reduction in face - to - face contact .
This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle .
For example , we tend to send a birthday wish when Facebook prompts us ' Today is someone 's birthday ' .
In fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We used to send greeting cards during the festive season , such as Chinese New Year , and we feel so good about writing one and receiving one with stamps on it .
Gone are the times when we used to send mass messages , and the recipient may feel less meaningful connections from such online wishes .
As time passes , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friend needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The users of every social media site need to strike a balance between the real world and the virtual one .
We should maximize the benefits of such platforms , but be careful of their impact on our actual lives .
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face - to - face meetings ; however , social media sites are merely tools that can enhance it .
Today , social media sites are commonly used in society .
I believe that 80 percent of people use social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
It consists of the functions of connecting , sharing , interacting , and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to the social media , which are concerning in society .
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily lives .
First , with the function of social media sites that connect people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and family , or even strangers , without any time or place constraints .
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who live in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over 1,000 miles between Singapore and these two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without needing to travel to other countries .
It saves a lot of money and time , as well as strengthening our relationship , even though we stay at different places around the world .
Besides that , a company can also use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook or Skype , to facilitate meetings with parties from projects around the world .
Substantial costs are saved by not having to make the tiresome journey from one point to another .
With the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors , which will benefit the company even more and boost its profits .
However , there are two sides to every story .
Some scholars argue that the use of social media reduces face - to - face connections between humans .
Since ancient times , humans have interacted with each other face - to - face .
Without the facial expression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers .
That is why facial expression is one of the most important elements in social learning .
In addition , social media sites will affect writing skills ; that is the prevailing point of view in society .
Based on the statistics report , the more writing skills will be reduced as the amount of time spent on social media increases .
I believe that most of us have had the experience of suddenly forgetting how to spell a word that we should know .
The auto - correction software is so effective when using an electronic device ; only then did we realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill for people who express their own feelings and opinions .
Privacy " is the word that has been popular over the past few decades .
Humans have their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , there is news that social media sites leak users ' information to companies without cash reimbursement .
Everything we type on social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising .
Although it may seem like there are no laws , and it 's your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong .
You are not only controlled by government laws , but also spied upon by the government .
In conclusion , every situation or issue has two sides to the story .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize technology effectively , we should make an effort to not only weigh the pros and cons but also emphasize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks .
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our next generation .
With the widespread spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming increasingly popular .
Getting connected on social media , such as Facebook and Twitter , has become a main trend as well as a part of daily work nowadays .
With this situation , both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily lives .
On one side , it is obvious that many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to stay in touch with each other at any time and anywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media makes it possible to have interactions by keeping up with comments .
When our phones are accidentally turned off , we can also use social media to get in touch with our friends .
Some people who attempt to speak in public can also actively participate in group chats via social media .
Besides , we can make even more friends through such interactions when our friends also bring their friends along .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update their friends ' statuses and stay in contact with them more frequently .
On the other side , we need to rethink about the influence(s ) brought by social media .
There are still many disadvantages to using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face - to - face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people 's lives , people are increasingly willing to use social media for chatting instead of face - to - face conversations , which have a time and place requirement .
People who are not good at public speaking may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can not be improved under this situation .
Secondly , people 's overaddiction may , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation can cause some social media users to suffer from an overdependence on virtual social networking .
More and more networking has been transferred to the internet from real - life .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing up with social changes to avoid getting hurt .
Thirdly , a lot of updates to luxury living standards as well as other showy situations may make people 's daily lives more and more extravagant , which is not an accurate social growth trend .
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addiction and their study and work may be greatly influenced .
Since we can see both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend of using social media may still last for a long time .
Therefore , every time we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dross can we make better use of social media .
In this sophisticated era , experts continue to produce inventions designed to make life easier .
Geographical and transportation barriers are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies have been enhanced continuously .
Telephone may be perceived as a big innovation since its introduction by Alexander Graham Bell for the first time .
However , since the internet was known , telephones started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages are given to the user .
Let 's take an example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their old acquaintances .
This benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's addresses may change from time to time . However , on Facebook , people can keep in touch with old friends just by using their names and photos as identifiers .
Facebook is like a combination of messaging and chatting services , personal profiles , media for sharing , and other entertainment add - ons .
Social games that allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time .
Twitter , which has a more simplified function compared to Facebook , provides more benefits when used as an information - sharing medium .
Twitter only allows users to post updates that are limited to short sentences in order to spread the word quickly , which means that only highlighted messages are delivered .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered , as multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , and even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays .
These advantages also come in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications on our smartphones .
Despite the luxury offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects that people may not realize until afterwards .
Research shows that face - to - face meeting frequency among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As a consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say ; however , in face - to - face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth , as it may not be well - arranged , is the picture of your personality .
This skill requires practice and can not be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having dinner together at a restaurant , but everyone is busy with their own gadgets , posting pictures on Facebook , updating their statuses on Twitter , or even chatting with friends .
These social media serve a purpose to bind people despite their geographical boundaries , but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as a result .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that was mentioned earlier , which can decrease qualitatively if we are accustomed to interacting with gadgets rather than human beings .
Another disadvantage that affects others is that by only showing selected parts of our lives , we build a " false impression " in the public .
We tend to only share our happy moments in the media .
Because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness , with no problems at all .
Other people are then influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people tend to think of themselves as lowly , which may lead to depression and mental disorders .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem that affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does not always provide advantages .
There are many disadvantages that people may not realize .
It is up to each person 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
So , we should never forget to think about and calculate the benefits and losses of every decision that we make .
Today , the advancement of technology improves the lives of many people greatly .
In most countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people believe that social media sites have benefits on communication between people , while others argue that there are several negative impacts on society .
One of the advantages that are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than ever before .
In the past decades , when social media sites were not yet fully developed , people connected with others who lived far away by using a phone , or even writing a letter .
However , calling someone by using a phone and writing someone a letter requires some cost , and sending a letter to someone who lives far away , especially in villages , takes a lot of time .
The appearance of those social media sites seems to cause these problems to be solved .
People connecting through social media sites can spend no money on communication , and it takes only one or a few seconds for the message to reach .
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience to many people .
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact someone they have not seen for a very long time , such as their friends from primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are unable to find them through a phone or a letter .
If phone or letter are the only ways to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to making connections between us and our old friends .
Hence , social media sites serve as a platform for connection .
Everything that comes with benefits will also have its disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts on people and society .
The advancement of social media sites has made people so reliant on them that some prefer using these sites to contact each other instead of talking to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought about by social media sites .
The use of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face - to - face human communication in real life , which will ultimately lead to the loss of interpersonal skills for many people .
As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with one another and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills results in an inability for people to present their ideas well .
As a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with one another in society .
In conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society .
As a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought about by the advancement of technology , and also learn to avoid the consequences and maximize the benefits of these technologies .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to stay in touch with people and stay up - to - date with the latest news has become a tremendous demand .
Some of the famous examples include social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook .
With an increasing number of more than one billion users from all over the world , social media sites have clearly demonstrated their success in playing an important part in our lives .
However , there are arguments that social media can bring about a reduction in face - to - face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society .
First and foremost , all social media sites are free .
All users need an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life .
Secondly , it helps people to stay in touch with one another .
Finding old friends through Facebook , for instance , is more easy than asking people around in real life .
Social media helps to reduce the hassle of geographical distance and bring people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites keep us up to date on the latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with just a click away on the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites also link people together by allowing us to create our own groups , pages , or sites to share our hobbies , interests , and studies in particular subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global interconnected world .
However , social media sites also have another side to their negative impact on humans .
Undeniably , it becomes more addictive when we spend more time busy socializing and interacting virtually .
We spend most of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter , and it affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the corporate world , employers often block social media networks to prevent employees from spending their office time on their personal leisure activities and instead concentrate on their work .
Using text - messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also brings in a negative impact for us in the long term .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on face - to - face interaction with one another .
Hence , it increases valuable interaction between humans and the time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs that occur on both social media sites , where people use fake IDs to insult or harass someone ; for example , the case of Heather Chua , which recently occurred on Facebook .
These malicious comments often go viral and create a strong negative effect on the real - life user , which may lead to an unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim .
In conclusion , everything has its two - sided effect and it depends on how we use it .
With current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technologically savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with one another through social media sites ; however , it does not mean that we should neglect face - to - face human interaction , as it plays an even more important role in our lives .
As more and more social websites , such as Twitter , Facebook , and Weibo , which have become ubiquitous , seamless , and imperative in our lives , people may worry that the younger generation has problems with face - to - face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms greatly outweigh their repercussions .
Social media enables us to explore the world from afar without paying expensive airplane tickets or taking a week - long holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
With a small smartphone or a computer at school , at work , or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with just a click and get to know about their lives through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos , and statuses .
Compared to face - to - face interaction , online conversations are easier for strangers to communicate with each other .
Since some of the information has already been revealed on the homepage , it is also easier to find some common topics to discuss .
Moreover , people usually like to share openly about their true feelings online , with their masks in reality being taken off .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 : 80 % of the information posted online is true , whereas a person may be accurate only about 30 % of the time in real life .
This suggests that a Facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a Facebook account .
That 's because we are being ourselves in reality , but we have no reason to be so in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as the prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh - meaning comments , we can minimize these repercussions through strict regulation of content online .
Another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy .
People around the world can easily share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions , where people are less aware of what is actually happening around them .
One of the examples is the 2012 riots that occurred in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed on quickly from Egyptians to people in Zambia through the use of social media .
However , as the government controls most of the media .
These social media can be tools of their campaign and manipulate the thoughts of the public .
For example , in the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr. Tan Chee Keong made use of Facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Although because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional media .
Intensive use of social media does reduce the amount of time people spend on face - to - face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table , each with a cell phone in their hand .
They are too busy with their many virtual friends , and some of them neglect the feelings of their real - life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is educate the public about the importance of having good friends by their side and teaching them to manage their time effectively .
In conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives .
What we can do is to carefully manage our time spent online and manage our words used online .
With the regulation of governments and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better place .
Social media 's role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thanks to social media , communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication , regardless of the distance , many other advantages , such as knowledge sharing and trade , can also be done through social media .
Nevertheless , with these advantages , some disadvantages may arise , including a reduction in face - to - face human contact , which affects interpersonal skills ; privacy issues ; and some frauds that can be committed through social media .
Twitter , Facebook , and Skype are some social media sites that enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries .
Through those sites , we are able to talk to them , learn what their activities are , and who their friends are , etc . From a surface - level perspective , it is no doubt that these sites help us maintain a better relationship with our relatives despite the distance .
The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well ; that 's why , nowadays , many news publishers make their own social media accounts . For example , Channel News Asia has a Twitter account and updates its followers with headline news .
That demonstrates how actual news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , this information can reach them easily without their needing to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people have started to conduct their business through these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it 's our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online . We can get to buy from and contact the sellers directly through these sites , which can be considered an advantage for us , the buyers .
However , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually as opposed to when we meet them in person ?
I do think there is a difference in it , and I believe that many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate virtually , we can hide behind our true feelings and may not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us .
Other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language , and thus the tone of the message sent and when it is received may be different .
Many people are very brave when telling others about their opinions online , but in real life , some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all .
This will lead to a bad interpersonal skill as well as a problem of trust .
Today , we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media , since we will never know whether they are even real .
Some people fake their identities on social media sites so that they can meet more people or some may even cheat others .
In addition , the privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share initially .
Therefore , while social media sites undoubtedly have benefits in our lives , we should consider their drawbacks and thus use them wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and minimize its disadvantages in the smallest way possible .
It 's a common sight that almost everyone on a public transportation is watching their phone or wearing an earpiece in this modern society today .
Not only one , but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .
Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution .
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people so that they can connect with others , even from different countries .
It also brings many negative effects , such as the loss of face - to - face communication skills , which is important in their workplace .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily lives .
One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach others easily , even if they have n't been in contact for a long time .
In this fast - paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media sites , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scenes onto it , and they can stay updated about the new information from their friends .
Personally , I am studying overseas , but a busy study life keeps me away from contacting my old friends .
Using a common social media site with my friends helps me stay up - to - date on what 's going on in their lives .
And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them .
In Singapore , many Malaysians cross the sea to work here .
Many of them are busy at work and spend time with their children .
One of the managers at my workplace has the same situation .
After my manager taught his mother how to use Facebook , he was able to upload video clips of his grandchild .
Therefore , my manager would not miss the moment of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationships .
People become more connected or closer when they share similar preferences .
It is easier for people to approach others after knowing the information .
Students can exchange their experiences in studies , even if they are in different countries .
People are able to share their culture through pretty photos online , thereby allowing others to spread joy with them .
Thus , I believe that social media sites are one of the most useful tools to help people know each other better .
However , social media sites are a double - edged sword ; they also bring about some negative effects on our daily lives .
One of the disadvantages that many people concern is that people lose the interest in face - to - face communication .
Many people like to use language to pretend to be themselves , and gain confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relations , even without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that they do affect some people 's ability to develop interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid their negative effects .
Social media sites should be a very useful and convenient tool to use , bringing people closer together in this globalized world .
The use of social media has largely influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends often become real - life friends , and real - life friends communicate with each other online .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
There are advantages and disadvantages in this change .
Social media has reshaped the way we communicate .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas , stories , and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting " and " listening " .
When we use Facebook and post pictures and status updates .
We are actively presenting faces of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with the best looks , statuses that are funny .
We broadcast these facades of ourselves to others .
The images we choose to present are tentatively considered .
The audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of seeking attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers are not the listeners .
They are simply scrolling through pages of pages of pictures and status updates when they come across one that they might think is funny .
It 's not the broadcasters themselves that they care about , but the content .
This type of communication does not help forming interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing friendships requires a mutual understanding of each other and caring for one another .
The latter requires face - to - face interaction , where we can show our emotions to others .
One can not truly understand a person by only stalking their Facebook page , where they carefully choose what to present .
One can not truly show one 's emotions to someone else by using texting smiley faces ( =) .
The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships .
However , it is good for sharing information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer .
With my social network account , I rarely read newspapers or visit news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them through the updates of my friends .
If I am interested in politics , I can simply follow some political news sources or public figures .
I get news about sales , clothes , and cosmetics from my friends .
If some of my friends have bad taste in clothes and they post them often , I can simply block them .
Information has been circulated .
The most popular information gets circulated the most , so I can rarely miss it .
Social networks play a role in providing and also filtering information .
This saves a lot of time for me when reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From both of these points of view , I think social media could foster more interest - based friendships .
With the help of social media , I become real - life friends with those from online forums who share the same interests as me .
I also discover some interests of my friends , which I find common with myself , so that talking to one another is much more enjoyable about life , studies , friends , etc .
The communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each other , but rather on what 's interesting or the content .
In this case , interpersonal skills are not as important because our goal is not to impress someone , but to gather the information that we are both interested in .
In conclusion , I believe that social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human - based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends to a more information - based friendship that requires a shared interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages to it , however , whether it is good or bad , we are still unsure .
It 's just different .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Daily Life
People who live in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults possess either a Facebook or a Twitter account .
It is true that social media enables people to connect with each other more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for some people , sharing some parts of their lives , such as videos and photos , on social media sites becomes really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered : a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with each other .
Instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of that " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites .
Therefore , there is a need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send postcards to keep in touch with those who lived far away from them in the past .
It can take a few days or weeks for them to receive the message .
Today , what people need to do is simply sit in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message .
Distance and time are no longer the problem , which is convenient , especially when instant chat is needed .
However , when people become increasingly addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with those who are close to them , their face - to - face interpersonal skills are lost .
Social media provides people with a way of talking and chatting that can never be considered a way of communication .
When one chats on those media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotional delivery , and even the expressions are typed in using some combinations of punctuation .
For greater convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words , such as " lol , " which means " laugh out loud , " and " ASAP , " which means " as soon as possible .
People indeed go to great lengths to make their words as short as possible .
While individuals are communicating with people in person , expressing themselves appropriately can become a big problem .
Social media also provides people with huge amounts of information about people and things that interest them .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people whom you adore , such as famous movie and television stars , businessmen , and entrepreneurs .
It makes people feel extremely close to their admirers ' lives and work .
Updated news that people care about can be easily obtained by refreshing your social media sites on your smartphones and laptops almost anytime .
However , after one has registered on those social media sites that are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future .
Furthermore , not everyone on social media sites is honest .
The profile picture may not be the person whom that user says he or she really is .
The reason might just be that he or she simply wants to decorate their face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side may be deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you .
No pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world , making instant communication possible .
And it becomes even more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and risks exposing them to individuals whose identities can not be verified on the social media sites .
How do social media help change our lives ?
As technology develops , social media plays an increasingly significant role in the entire world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas , and a lot of other things that help their friends know their lives better .
However , it also raises the concern about whether it brings us more benefits or a humanitarian disaster .
Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it also reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face - to - face , which may affect our interpersonal skills .
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being .
Many people say that they will support social media because it really helps them to have a closer view on how their friends are doing in other parts of the world .
This is especially for people who are overseas .
To them , social media is the only resource through which they can learn about everything that has happened in their home country , and it 's also the way they can use to share their lives with their loved ones .
What 's more , these days , social media plays an important role in spreading information .
Today , people can simply post their rental information on their Facebook account and wait for responses from others around the world , bringing us a significant amount of convenience .
It is quite significant , especially for those young teenagers , since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what has happened in this world than read the newspaper every day .
However , there are also a great many people who are against this technology .
They worry a lot about the negative impact on the teenagers who are still developing themselves .
They point out that social media actually reduces the chances for us to talk to people around us face - to - face .
The more we care about Facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
Today , it is quite common to see at some parties that people would rather look at their phones and read all the posts on Facebook if they feel bored .
It makes people worry that if all teenagers continue to use social media frequently , they will decrease their ability to talk to people .
They will feel that it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to talk about with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings fewer disadvantages than advantages it gives us .
Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let others know that we really do lead a good life , it can also waste a lot of our time as well .
Think about it in another way : if we put the time we spend wandering on those sites to good use , we might have already finished one book or done something more meaningful .
We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our families or friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely , regardless of whether it 's really good or not .
As a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media platforms .
As stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all lead a better life .
The advantages and disadvantages of social media
Today , as technology becomes increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are appearing in our daily lives .
You can see people playing Facebook and Twitter on their smartphones or iPads on buses or trains .
Some may say that the rise of modern media will reduce the chances of people communicating face - to - face .
This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society .
Firstly , of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and connect with each other .
Years ago , when these modern products were not yet popular , the ways for people to communicate or contact people far away were still restricted to making phone calls , sending emails , or writing letters .
Some may take a long time , while others are not efficient enough for people to receive their responses .
However , social media solves these problems well .
People can contact their friends on the internet and receive their replies very quickly .
The communication is also not limited in words .
People can express themselves through pictures or emotions .
People can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts online .
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situations and see the comments online ; they can also share their opinions on these websites .
These social media make people 's lives much more colorful and provide a lot of fun .
However , social media may also do some harm to people 's lives .
It will make people spend more time chatting online rather than communicating face - to - face , which means that their interpersonal skills will be badly affected .
Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget about their real lives .
Actually , I have seen some people who are very funny and interesting when I 'm chatting with them online .
However , they behave quite boringly when I talk to them in real life .
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up .
If they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems for their mental development .
They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face - to - face .
Some people may share less and less time with their families and not know how to express themselves .
Moreover , some incorrect values on the website will affect teenagers and confuse them .
Some may even do something incorrectly .
In conclusion , the rise of social media sites is a double - edged sword .
It can make our lives simpler .
People can promote their friendships and relationships through these social media .
Whereas it can also make people forget to communicate with their family and friends in real life , and affect them negatively in their interpersonal skills .
But overall , the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages .
So , we need to make the most effective use of these social media and make it a fun way to add some excitement when life becomes boring .
And try to bypass the shortcoming .
Remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
The appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely .
People can know what their friends have recently looked at and interesting things that happen to them by checking their Facebook or other social media sites .
We can not deny that social media sites truly enable old friends not to lose touch with each other 's information and the chance to communicate with one another , even if you are in a different country .
However , social media sites truly reduce face - to - face communication , which truly affects interpersonal skills .
There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using social media in people 's daily lives .
Firstly , social media sites can connect people with their friends and family closely .
By typing out the words and sharing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they might be too shy to express .
For example , on Mother 's Day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers , so they can type it on her or his mother 's Facebook page .
Then their mother will also know the emotion and feel warm .
On the other hand , when a teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is often the only way they can communicate with their parents and friends .
Therefore , social media is truly beneficial for people .
Secondly , social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely .
People can also learn much information about celebrities like Obama and Bill Gates on Twitter and Facebook , and gain access to first - hand study materials .
They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and get to know these famous persons ' thoughts by using social media .
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or individuals who need money to cure a disease can get help from the world quickly . Once one person knows the information , he or she will share it with their friends , and then many people will learn about it and spread the information to those who can provide assistance .
On the other hand , there are also problems with the population of social media .
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and family , they will become accustomed to communicating by typing rather than talking .
People even prefer talking to their friends and meeting them online , but gradually rejecting face - to - face communication .
Therefore , social media can truly limit interpersonal skills , causing people to lose the chance and ability to practice talking and connect with their friends .
Secondly , without effective communication in real life , people lose the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood .
There are many people on social media who have beautiful images and good content on their pages ; however , in real life , they may not have jobs or live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheated , losing money , even from their savings .
Therefore , the social media is not safe , which is bad for teenagers ' future development .
All in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a great deal in many areas .
However , there are some disadvantages that will affect people to some extent .
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily Life and Society .
Today , with the development of technology and society , social media has become more popular and increasingly important in our daily lives .
We communicate with others using social media , such as Twitter , Facebook , and microblogging more and more frequently .
There is no need for people to go out of their homes to interact with others ; they can chat online , share pictures , tell others what they 've done , or share funny stories .
It appears that people build a good relationship with others through social media , but problems often arise .
People do not know how to talk with others face - to - face , especially with strangers .
Then , we need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and in society .
As for the advantages , there are two aspects : it is more convenient to contact others ; it is also easier to learn about others .
One advantage is that it is more convenient to contact others through social media .
In old days , if someone wanted to tell some important news to another person who lived far away , he needed to write letters , and it wasted time .
The long distance and time - consuming nature makes spreading the message very difficult at that time .
Therefore , people may not contact their far - away friends and relatives unless there is something important .
However , people can now contact anyone all over the world who uses a computer at any time , and there is no time delay in messages .
The other advantage is that it is easier to learn about others through social media .
If there is no social media , it is difficult for people to learn about a stranger .
They may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues , or family members .
And the information collected may not be entirely intact and true .
Unlike today , with the help of social media , people can easily get the information they want just by searching online , and know about what that person did every day at what time .
As for the disadvantages of social media in our daily life , they include wasting time , causing illnesses related to prolonged sitting in front of a computer , the rapid spread of rumors and fake news , and most importantly , eroding people 's ability to converse confidently with others face - to - face .
It 's weird that people sit around the table , but all face their phones and do n't talk to each other .
If there is a joke on their Facebook page , they may talk to others in this way : " Hi , look , how ridiculous this is ! " Then they will laugh together .
No matter if it 's a party , dinner , or just a simple get - together , there are always some people who bow their heads and play with their phones , even when their family and friends are right in front of them .
In a conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life .
People should enjoy the advantages of social media while being aware of its disadvantages and try their best to avoid those disadvantages from happening to themselves , their friends , and family .
Today , the world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which are attractively connecting people around the world .
However , some people worry that social networks can affect interpersonal skills as they reduce face - to - face human contact .
The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows .
Nobody can deny the advantages of social media , which provide benefits in connecting people regardless of their nationalities , races , cultures , and languages .
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable means of communication .
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world .
It has erased the boundaries of distance and time .
No more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages .
Today , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
You can share photos , videos , and any meaningful experiences of your life .
More importantly , it is both cheap and easy to use social media .
Secondly , social media networks open doors of opportunity for people due to their great benefits in connecting .
A lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter .
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends , and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world .
In the business arena , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services .
On the other hand , social media also has its disadvantages , which have created worries for society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon .
More and more young people tend to live in a social media world for most of their time , reducing face - to - face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life .
First and foremost , we should realize that the social media world is not trustworthy or real .
Everyone can easily make up their own personality and characteristics they want .
They can become anyone .
Though social media can create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face - to - face interactions .
There is a story about a girl who lives in the social media world every night for eight years .
In the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight individuals .
She talks with them every night , trusts them , and shares her life with them .
Then , eventually , she discovered that eight people became one because he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time .
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also one of its weaknesses .
A lot of people use their own personal information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception .
People can use this information to deceive family and friends , as well as banks , to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft , and so on .
Last but not least , social media can affect human interpersonal skills when people spend more time on social sites and miss out on opportunities to engage in social daily life activities as well as interact with others .
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
As a result , if the situation continues to follow this unexpected trend , it will have a bad effect on the younger generation .
To put it in a nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
So does social media network .
It 's not only convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing businesses , but it also can damage people 's relationships and interpersonal skills .
Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way , combining both social media sites and daily life interactions to develop people 's potential to its fullest .
