If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it does not necessarily mean that you will definitely develop heart disease.

Explanation: The original sentence uses ""does not mean"" which implies a lack of certainty, but then contradicts itself by using ""definitely"". Instead, the corrected sentence uses ""necessarily"", which conveys a stronger sense of probability."

Explanation:
The original text had two errors:

1. ""firghtenning"" should be spelled as ""frightening"".

Explanation:
* ""For an example"" is not a common idiomatic expression; instead, use ""For instance"".
* ""family potential disease"" is unclear; rephrase as ""a family disease"" or specify which type of disease.
* ""we can always look for more chances"" is awkward phrasing; rephrase as ""we can always look for more opportunities"".

1. ""obeys"" is not the correct verb here; instead, the phrase ""obeys their own willingness"" is redundant and unclear.

* ""And"" is not necessary at the beginning of the sentence; it's better to start with a clear subject (""my opinion"").
* ""seems"" is a more formal and suitable verb to use instead of ""to be"".
* ""at the first place"" is a phrase that doesn't quite fit here; it's better to replace it with ""in the first place"", which is a common idiomatic expression."

* Added ""an"" before ""unhealthy baby"" to maintain consistent article usage.
* Changed ""may cause"" to ""could lead to"", as ""cause"" implies a direct causal link, whereas ""lead to"" suggests a more indirect consequence.

"Though social media need not be necessarily bad, it must be used accordingly - for work, family, friends.","Though social media need not be necessarily bad, it must be used accordingly - for work, family, friends.",[],"Here is the corrected text:

Although social media does not necessarily have to be bad, it must be used appropriately - for work, family, and friends.

Explanation:
* ""Though"" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause, but it's not necessary here. Instead, use ""although"" to introduce the contrasting idea.
* ""need not"" is a bit formal and less common; instead, use ""does not necessarily"" for better clarity.
* ""necessarily"" is a adverb that means ""in a way that is required or expected"", so it's used correctly here.
* ""must"" is a strong verb that implies obligation, which fits well with the idea of using social media responsibly.
* ""accordingly"" is an adverb that means ""in a suitable or appropriate manner"", which fits well with the idea of using social media for specific purposes.
* Added ""and"" before ""friends"" to make the list of purposes more natural-sounding."

Another problem with social media is that the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy are not reflected as something positive to the users.

Corrected errors:

* ""that"" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause, so it should be followed by a comma.
* ""the benefits"" is a plural noun phrase, so it should agree with the subject ""are"" in the main clause.
* ""reflected"" is a verb that takes the object ""something positive"", so it should be used instead of ""reflected"".
* ""to the users"" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun ""benefits"", so it should be placed after the verb ""reflected""."

The reason why it is so addictive is that the more people get into social media, the more they seek attention from their friends.

Explanation:
1. Comma splice error: The original sentence uses a comma to separate two independent clauses, which is incorrect. A conjunction (such as ""because"" or ""since"") is needed to connect the two clauses.
2. Lack of article: The phrase ""the social media"" should include the definite article ""the"" before ""social media"".
3. Pronoun error: The pronoun ""they"" refers back to ""people"", but it's better to use the subject-verb agreement and say ""more they seek""."

Explanation:
The original sentence contains several errors. Firstly, ""appearance"" does not fit well in this context; instead, ""advent"" is a better choice to describe the introduction of modern media. Secondly, ""for"" is not necessary before ""these modern media"", as it's not modifying anything specific. Finally, ""chance"" is replaced with ""chances"" to agree with the plural subject ""people""."
